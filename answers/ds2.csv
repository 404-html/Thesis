"Out With A Bowling Pin Before.



Hey know, that's discriminatory! I ain't no bowling pin - I'm a motherfucking juggling club, not some namby-pamby pin that exists purely to be knocked down by some asshole spheroid!



I Apologize For Insulting You But Could You Please Tone Down Your Profanities?  Your Language Is Clashing With The Sumptuous Surroundings.



Okay okay, I'm sorry for yelling, but it just really gets on my nerves when people make baseless derogatory assumptions like that.



Again I Did Not Mean To Insult You.



I know babe, I know, and I'm sorry for my outburst.  It's just something I have to deal with on a regular basis, you know?  And I mean, I look nothing at all like a bowling pin! Those assh- er, those jerks are squat and round while I'm pleasingly lanky.



I Must Admit You Are Well-



Erm



Proportioned.



And so are you, babe.  Love the dress, by the way, very classy, yet it doesn't hide your stunning figure.



Oh Um Thank You. I Actually Designed It Myself.



No shit!  Really?



Yes Shit.  Hee Hee.



Ha ha ha ha! That was a good one!  Man, you're beautiful, talented, and got a sense of humour to boot! What are you doing here with a grungy club like me?



Oh Don't Say That I Think You Are Actually Very Handsome.  Your Blue Tie Sets Off Against Your White...



Um...



Skin?



Very Nicely.



Sure babe, you can call it skin if that works for you.  So, going back to my original question, what do you like to do for fun? Design clothes?



Yes I Enjoy Aesthetic Design Very Much And Am Actually Finishing Up Design School Currently.  I Also Like To Read.  But Generally I Just Like Making Things - Clothes Especially - But I Enjoy All Sorts Of Physical Creation And Manifestation.  I've Even Been Known To Partake In Woodworking.



Man, and all I'm good at is being flipped around in the air!



Hee Hee Well You Do Look Very Aerodynamic.



Well, maybe if you play your cards right, later I can show you just how aerodynamic I can be. ;)



...



Well That's A Very Tempting Offer To Be Sure But Oh Look Our Food Is Here.



ALRIGHT, CHOW DOWN FUCKMUNCHES.



FUCKMUNCHERS.







FOODMUNCHERS.







FOODFUCKMUNCHIES.







FUCKERFOODMUNCHES.







OH FUCK YOU AND YOU BETTER FUCKING TIP WELL.







ENJOY YOUR MEAL, GLOBESTIFFLERS.







Damn, our waiter is very...



Colorful?



Yeah... that's a good word for it.  ...Well, shall we dig in?



Lets.

Oh man, these cajun-shrimp chimichangas topped with curried goulash are delicious.



I Don't Know If I Will Be Able To Have A Dessert After This.

The Meals Are As Filling As They Are Delicious.



Exactly. So, when are you planning on graduating? Are you gonna try an work in the fashion industry afterwards?



No No We've Talked Far Too Much About Me. I'd Like To Know About You.



Okay, shoot.  Whatchoo wanna know about me?



We Have Thoroughly Canvassed The Subject Of What My Pleasure Activities Are But I Would Like To Know Yours.



Well, I'm not sure I can properly discuss my pleasure activities in such polite company... ;)



You Know What I Meant. What Do You Like To Do For Fun?



Well, I live a very active life, obviously, so most of my leisure time is spent being, well, leisurely - you know, hanging out, watching TV, resting, and lots of sleep.  My day job tires me out like you wouldn't believe.



I Would Imagine So.



Plus my klutz of an owner drops me fairly often, so I need plenty of rest to recuperate.



Does Being Dropped Actually Physically Hurt You?



Well, usually not, but it hurts emotionally, you know?  It's like he doesn't really care.



There There I Am Sure It Is Not Intentional He Is Just A Little Prone To Accident.



Yeah, I guess.  So anyway, that's mostly what I do for fun, but if I'm well-rested and I have a little extra time off, then I like to go... clubbing.

It was truly my pleasure, Kanaya.  I hope you had fun?



I Did.



So, um, is there a chance that maybe we could, you know, do this again some time?

"and heightening the particular fantasy Dirk had running through his head.

 

Dirk, on all fours, wiggled his ass up and down, causing the ""handlebars"" of the JPEG to stroke up and down his legs, sending a shiver down Dirk's spine.  As Dirk continued, he pondered which toy to use next.  River?  Thematic, yes, but too similiar to One and Two.  Sun?  A classic, to be sure, but a little to plain for Dirk's current mood.  Rice field? Car? Sushi?  Don't make him laugh.  If only... Dirk stared longingly at Woman - how he desperately wished he was up to the challenge (the irony of using such an object was undeniable) - but he knew he just wasn't cut out for it.  Maybe with some more practice, but with that long horizontal line he just wasn't go to get anywhere far with it.  Dirk sighed and grabbed Man - maybe he could claim double reverse irony?  But he really didn't care at that moment about irony, he just needed MORE.

 

Dirk yanked the Mountain out of him, gasping a bit at the sudden sensation of emptiness.  He quickly stuffed the Man inside him - too quickly.  Grunting with pain, he grabbed the two handles now sticking out of his butt, and used them to manuever the square box into a more comfortable position, and tried to relax around its girth.  In about a minute, the pain had ceased, and he started to ride the familiar train higher and higher into pleasure.  Dirk could feel his cock hardening as he slowly but surely started to pummel himself in the ass, both hands still gripping his ""tails"".  Soon though, he was already bored, and he needed more.  More carefully this time, he eased Man out of him, and with a wicked grin, picked up Small.

 

While Small was indeed not the largest toy in his collection, it had two loosely connected angled rods which he just adored.  He couldn't get enough of the feeling of them slowly but surely widening him out at an angle, preparing him for further pleasures.  Fortunately, the connection between the main rod and the two angled ones was rather strong this time - while no connection appeared on paper, you could always count on extra lines, bumps, squiggles, et cetera with his Bro's camera.  Not to mention the colors and patterns - Dirk had long since stopped paying attention to those, because they sometimes hindered his otherwise profound enjoyment.  After just a few minutes with Small, Dirk was ready for Big.  While similiar in some ways to Woman, Big's horizontal line was somewhat smaller, and there was more length to be enjoyed before reaching that killjoy.  Usually Dirk used Big as a palate cleanser, something smaller to psyche himself up for the final toys.  But today Dirk decided to flip the tables on the irony of using Small as a big toy and Big as a small toy - he was going to take Big all the way.

 

Dirk easily inserted the top length, savoring this painless pleasure for a few seconds, gritted his teeth, and then began to work the rest of the JPEG inside himself.  It took many minutes of straining and self-encouragement, but he finally had half of Big inside him - he couldn't help but feel proud.  But he wasn't done yet.  The tapered tails of Big terminated in points even wider apart than the width of the first half of Big, and he couldn't wait.  But he had not anticipated how hard moving the rest of Big inside him would be, even with half of it in.  The horizontal length did NOT want to go any further, and Dirk eventually had to concede defeat.  As he removed Big, he cried out in pain, and he felt something dripping down the back of his legs, but his erection was now stark and hard as a rock.  Dirk considered Meat, another toy he had long lusted after purely for connotative reasons, but he just couldn't take something so squaroid again, not after Big.

 

Dirk returned to Small as he contemplated what to finish himself off with.  His erection was straining against gravity, and despite the recent pain, pleasure had quickly overwhelmed him, and he knew he was running out of time.  Suddenly, a flash of inspiration hit him, and he grabbed the pen and paper, and scrawled a sigil as best he could, and took a terribly shaky pic.  Dirk almost ceased all activity when he saw the output.  It was... it was... perfect.  The delicious-looking hook was there, but now the three errant droplets had been strung along, connected to the bottom of the hook.  Dirk hastily removed Small, and then, slowly, reverently inserted Heart.

 

The three big pearls slipped inside him, one after another, with the most delicious sensations.  Dirk's head was already swimming, and he was finding it hard to keep his glasses on.  But when he inserted the whole length, save the hook, he couldn't keep from screaming in frenzied pleasure.  He knew he wouldn't",candidate00001
"he had cosmic inevitability on his side, as from his perch in his moon mansion, he saw a very small meteor plummet towards Alternia.

 

Tavros yelped and nearly toppled backwards out of his chair as a small rock hurtled into his hive, barely missing his carefully constructed deck, and completely obliterating Stop Being The Troll Other Trolls Want To Troll, And Become The Troll Who Trolls Other Trolls - An Instructional Twelve Step Guide With Informational Charts And Appendices.  As the puff of charred pages slowly floated back to the ground, Tavros noticed there was a dark green piece of... well it couldn't be paper, it'd have burnt off... wrapped around the rock.  He wheeled over and managed to scoop it up.  It certainly felt like paper...

 

Written on the paper in perfect white script, was simply ""Please highlight the mysterious blank spaces, Mr. Nitram"".  Confused, Tavros hastily scooted around back to his husktop, and highlighting the vast expanses of white, and proceeded to read line after line about how Tavros wasn't going to read this text until he was reading this and ha ha hee hee hoo hoo I'm so self assured and - Tavros had to stop reading.  He just couldn't take this strange man's cocky assertiveness, and decided to give him a piece of his mind.

 

""sO, I WANTED TO TELL YOU"", he typed, ""tHAT YOU ARE VERY SELF-ASSURED, aND KIND OF, cOCKY, aND I WAS WONDERING IF, yOU'D KINDLY, uM, tEACH ME HOW TO BE LIKE YOU? iF THAT'S ALRIGHT WITH YOU?""  Immediately, white text sprang forth, which Tavros quickly highlighted, to read:

 ""Mr. Nitram, normally I would be delighted to help you, but as you no doubt are unaware, but I am very much aware, I am very busy at this time, and I'm afraid I really can't afford to take the time to teach you to be just as suave, self-confident, and as excellent a host as me.""  Tavros slumped his shoulders in familiar defeat.  ""But please do right your shoulders, dear boy,"" the white text continued, ""as I'm willing to make you a deal.  Are you, by any chance, familiar with a game called 'Fiduspawn'?""  Tavros excitedly typed back that he was, amazed at his luck.  ""Excellent.  Of course, any pretense of chance I may have implied to you previously was of course an illusion.  We are both of course familiar with Fiduspawn, and soon, we will begin playing said game under a wager of sorts.  Simply put, if you win, I will take time out of my busy schedule to teach you my ways.""

 ""bUT, uM, wHAT IF YOU WIN?""

 ""Then I will take time out of my busy schedule to teach you my ways.""

 ""aLRIGHT, iT'S A DEAL,"" Tavros typed back, and gathered up his cards and host plushie.  He was going to go back to Trollian and ask how the mysterious man intended to play without being in the same room, when suddenly another rock flew into Tavros' hive, destroying nothing of note, but widening the hole in his wall considerably.  Wrapped around the meteorite was another plushie, but this one seemed even more full than usual.  Tavros watched in astonishment as the plushie unwound itself from the rock, bent over, and vomited out a stack of cards, which it began to shuffle.  This was certainly an unusual Fiduspawn match he was about to play, but even if he lost, Tavros was assured to get what he wanted nevertheless.

 Tavros put up a valiant effort, but eventually his death points had accrued 23, one more and it would be Game Over.  Fingers trembling, he reached into the deck and - AHA! Grinning, Tavros slapped down Leavings Technician, causing two damage to his opponent, bringing their Death Points up to 13, and allowing him to search his desk, remove all three Sentient Hoofbeast Leavings, and put them all in play.  ""Um, your turn!"" he said to the ever silent plush he was playing against, already starting to feel a bit of confidence, and his training hadn't even begun yet!  His opponent plush seemed like it was thinking hard about its options, and then suddenly whisked all of his active cards into the discard pile.

 ""So, you concede, then!"" Tavros started to say, when the host plush slapped down Rise With Ashes.  Tavros gasped - it was arguably the most powerful, and inarguably the most rare card in the whole game.  It required intense sacrifice, but promised wondrous rewards.  Tavros gulped and looked at his own plush, from which suddenly erupted a scaley little monster.  Tavros groaned, and turned to shake hands with his opponent, but stopped as a strange green light started to crackle around the room.  He watched, transfixed, as the opponent plush grew, and changed, until suddenly there was a four foot tall person with a large, perfectly round, white head before him.

"to claim our prize and enter our new world.  The final universe.  The end of the chain.

 

And we did.

 

But it wasn't a new world. Not really.

 

And it definitely wasn't final.  Not if I have anything to say about it.

 

====-====

 

You see, Dave had a good reason to be freaked out about something.  He always did have an uncanny sense of time.  You remember when I told you about how the smallest piece of data could bring down even the most complex of programs?  It turns out that at the moment we slew the Gray Monarch we were 4 days, 13 hours, 6 minutes, and 12 seconds into our session. 

 

I told you we were fast.

 

Some process running in the background of the universe recorded this timecode, and normally that data would have just been stored, for, I dunno, a high-score table? Data analysis?  Are there possibly beings above our realm of comprehension who need user stats, to balance the playing difficulty of the universe or whatever?  I don't even want to think about that.  But instead of taking up space on some pan-dimensional hard drive or being made into the spreadsheet that runs all existences, those particular numbers freaked the system the hell out.  It's no one's fault, really - programs, like ectobiology, are tricky things.  That's what bug testing is all about - you never know what combination of seemingly random and unrelated scenarios and datae will cause an adverse reaction.

 

But for some reason, thinking back on it, I get the strange feeling that maybe this wasn't an accident.  Maybe this wasn't a glitch.  Maybe it was intended.

 

But that really doesn't matter now.

 

 

====-====

 

 

So, that's how I ended up here: Universe i.  As in the square root of negative one.  You know how in old school games like the original Mario, or the first couple Pokemon games, you could glitch yourself into a strange area of the game, made up of random bits of previously used code?  Negative world, or Glitch zone, or whatever?  This is the universe we ended up in.  But here's the thing about those glitchy areas of video games - they only look glitchy if you've actually played the game in its functioning state.  But if the only Pokemon you've ever encountered was Missingno, you'd take it for granted that all Pokemon looked like vaguely phallic blocky shapes.  And for some reason, I'm the only one that remembers that Pokemon actually look like vaguely phallic blocky shapes with giant eyes and some shitty pun as a name.

 

So here I am - every day I have to go out and exist in this society, and I'm the ONLY ONE who sees how fucked up it is.  The moons.  The way streets are laid out.  Her Delirious Conksucksion.  Even indoor plumbing didn't make it through the... the whatever happened to us.  It wasn't a Scratch.  Not really.  And I've long since given up hope that this is a doomed timeline, and relatively soon, all this would vanish.  But it many ways it was a reset of some sort, or more accurately, a rewind.  The kind that messes up your tape.  You know how the places of Ancestors and Younglings switch in the case of a Scratch?  Well, with our, yeah, let's call it a Rewind, we all got switched back to our original factory settings.  No longer Dirk Strider, I am now once again Bro, the faceless automaton.

 

And I am alone.

 

 

====-====

 

 

Well, not truly alone.  Now I have you. 

 

Mmmmmm, you do know how treat a boy right, don't you?

 

Mmmmm...

 

Yesssssssssssss

 

Ahem.  There's plenty more of that where it came from, but I need to finish telling you this.  Where was I?

 

Ah, right, Alone.  Well, we both know that's not strictly true, but, present company excluded, I wish it was.  Do you have any idea how hard it is to see your best friends, your family, and have most of them not remember you at all, and NONE of them remember everything you all had been through?  I've put a lot of thought into why I remember when no one else does.  I've also spent a lot of time wondering if maybe what I ""remember"" never happened.  Maybe this insanity truly is perfectly normal.  But, no, I must believe that everything I know we went through truly happened - there really is no Alterniative.  Sorry, alternative.  Post-Rewind Dave has this terrible habit of making incredibly shitty puns, and I fear it's been wearing off on me.

 

Anyway, I think I may have figured out why I remember the little I do, when everyone else remebers nothing.  You see, I was the only one who didn't hit God Tier.  We all planned it so we could lie on our Quest Beds, fall peacefully asleep, and be killed instantly and painlessly, so",candidate00001
"survive the brooding caverns, nonetheless ever become a person of any interest, even an omniscient, nearly omnipotent being like himself needed downtime.

As Doc Scratch watched the progress of the small brown-blooded grub, however, he found himself concentrating less and less on his endless inner monologue, and more on the actions of the grub he was watching. So far it had passed all but the most difficult challenge of the brooding caverns, evading wild Alternian animals, managing to skitter over relatively large chasms, and even evading geysers of randomly spouting acidic rain - using a rhythmic sort of dance, no less! Sure, some grubs just charged straight through that challenge, and the ones that died, died, and the ones that survived were made hardier for their trials. But this grub was displaying a surprising knack for evasion, not something Doc Scratch had carefully groomed this species to be naturally adept at.

As the grub entered the final cavern, Doc Scratch began to watch in something akin to real interest, a feeling he had not felt in quite some time. The final cavern was in fact one of many final caverns in the brooding complex. They had been designed to funnel roughly the same number of grubs to each of the hundreds of final chambers, from which many grubs would enter, but only one could leave, ensuring that only the strongest of the strong would make it into troll society.  As dozens of grubs charged at each other, tackling, scratching, and gnawing until blood and pulp lay strewn about the cavern floor, the small brown grub skittered up onto a ledge, and carefully edged its way along it, above the action, and towards the exit, from which it would follow more corridors until it wound up running into the lusus that would take care of it for the rest of its life.

 Meanwhile, the grubs fighting on the ground had been narrowed down to five, and the fighting had gotten truly vicious. Doc Scratch was silently commending the young brown grub on its strategy of waiting and then pouncing when they were all exhausted, showing cunning and ruthlessness, but he was almost positive that even with that advantage the grub would not survive a battle with any of the grubs below, nonetheless the large blue one that was assuredly going to win.

And thus the large blue-blooded grub did win, but Doc Scratch didn't even feel his usual smugness at being correct (and since he was always correct, there was hardly a time when he wasn't smug), for he was ever so slightly... sad? Disappointed? These were not familiar emotions to him. But nevertheless, he felt some sort of... longing, he guessed, for the brown-blooded grub to make it out alive, but there was no way it could win against the... wait, what's this?

Doc Scratch refocused his omniscience, and saw that during the fray the small grub had simply exited the cavern, technically completing his trials.  Doc Scratch chuckled to himself - the grub had showed not ruthlessness, but cunning of a different sort. It had done its best to stay alive, and succeeded.  Doc Scratch continued to watch as the grub was found by a small winged lusus, not much bigger than the grub itself, and the lusus garbled a name to the small grub.

""Tavros... Nitram. Hmmm... I will have to keep an eye on you, young Mister Nitram."" Doc Scratch then spent many happy hours internally monologuing about how he couldn't actually keep an eye on the young troll due to his lack of any actual eyes.

Enthusiasm is just one of the many traits Doctor Scratch admires in his favorite pupil.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

Doctor Scratch was well known for playing favorites and having star students, and this year's crop was no exception. It might not have been the most strictly rule-abiding way of doing things, but ""Doc"" Scratch hadn't gotten a cushy teaching job at Skaia University with a frankly ludicrous tenure clause in his contract by playing the rules. After all, he himself had been helped out when he was a lad by superiors who noticed his talent and keen intellect, and it was nothing if not his duty to do the same for this next generation of rising stars. It was just his way of being... what was a good way of putting it? Ah, yes. Hospitable.

There were plenty of excellent students to show favoritism to this year - Miss Lalonde was certainly deserving of it (much more attentive than her equally talented but unfortunately distracted older sister), but Miss Serket had an undeniable streak of ambition that Scratch could not help but admire. These and many others would all be obvious candidates for some... extra guidance... but Scratch had found him irrevocably drawn to a rather unlikely student - Mr. Nitram. Truth be told, besides a quick appraisal of the width of the wheelchair the mohawked boy had wheeled in on and whether or not the exactingly tidy rows of desks in his classroom would have to be adjusted (they did not), he at first spared the boy barely a first glance, not to mention a second one.

But as the",candidate00001
"Derse lay still and quiet.  Night-time, or what passed for night-time on the perpetually dark planet, hung thick and heavy like the internet's stereotyped pre-conception of what a naked human male with a high concentration of melanin in his pigment looks like.  The Black Queen slipped silently through the shadows.  She was sure her Archangent, Jack Noir, would be monitoring the throne room and wonder where she was off to, but she didn't care.  The little game they played had long grown stale, and she hungered for fresher, sweeter meats.  With calculated speed and skill, she scrambled up the long chain that connected Derse to her moon, and the Dersites to their Dreamers.

The chain was old and pockmarked, and the Queen could skitter up its underside like an insect.  After an hour of hard work (and a few brief pauses), the Black Queen had finally scaled all the way to the top of the chain, and took a few laboured steps on Derse's moon, before resuming her usual graceful, confident stride.  You could say she was an adept... strider.

Moving quickly now, as her hunger was starting to reach its peak, the Black Queen hurried into one of the towers of the Derse Dreamers.  Knowing there was no need, she opened the door quietly, and snuck inside.  She knelt before the youngling on its bed, and removed the covers with an almost tender air.  Licking her lips, heart thumping in her chest, she eagerly put one long smooth hand inside the young boy's pants, and began stroking his... wait.

She had ensnared the wrong meal - this was the girl.







Shit.









The Black Queen then hurried quickly out of the room, down the tower, and then into the opposite tower.  Rather annoyed at this point, she blasted through the door, though the sleeping boy did not stir.  She mentally chastized herself as she yet again set to work - It's the boy who wears the ridiculous ocular obscurers, not the other one! Duh! However, she did not spend much time on self-flaggelation... at least not yet.  There was work to be done.  Her carapaced fingers clacking together wickedly, she slipped her hand inside Dave's purple pajama pants, pleasingly pressing and patiently pulling on pre-pubescent phallus.  Fortunately for her, Dave's sword was not yet broken, seeing as the game was yet to start.  Hell, no one had even prototyped yet!  But this set-up time was running out, and the Queen was going to get the most out of her body while it was still her own, and not subject to the ill-informed whims of 13-year-old humans.

Pulling Dave's pants farther down, the Black Queen continued to glide her smooth fingers up and down his length.  Though unconcious in this realm (and, indeed, the other), he still seemed to be enjoying the treatment in some way, and was soon fully erect.  The Black Queen grinned, licked her lips, and prepared to enjoy her meal.  Hovering her face above his stark member, she exhaled soft warm breath on the tip, and slowly, loving licked it.  The unconcious lad bucked his hips slightly upward in response.  Taking this as encouragement, the Queen slowly took him into her mouth, white flesh being swallowed up by shiny black carapace.  Soon the Black Queen's nose was nestled in Dave's phlourescent pink pubic phollicles.  She slowly rose her mouth back up his turgid cock, licking all the way, and then slammed her face back down, resting a startled snort from the boy.

Soon the Black Queen was bobbing her head eagerly up and down Dave's dick (deliciously and daintily), while her own fingers were nestled tight within her chessgina, which is like a vagina, but for chess people.  Attuned the beat and rhythm of the world, she could easily tell by the pulsing of his blood and the straining of his flesh that Dave's tinklewinkle was about ready to pop.  Grinning mischievously, the Queen picked up her pace to an almost suicidal pace, spittle and pre-cum flying through the air, her fingers pistoning in and out of her chessgina.  With one almighty buck of his hips, Dave came, fast and hard, as did the Queen at the exact same time.  Because that's apparantly some gog-damned rule in these kinds of fics.

 

Ahem.

 

Anyways, the Black Queen swallowed the first load, but then lifted her face off his manhood, and let his cum rain down on her smooth black carapace.  She then had to sit back on the purple floor and catch her breath for a moment.  Smiling, she pulled the young boy's pants back up, tucking his now rapidly deflating cock inside, and sauntered back to Derse, exhausted but sated.  She would miss these little meals when the game started.

TG: i hesitate to tell you this but



TG: i had a really weird dream last night
",candidate00001
"he would have been grudgingly proud, but his own luck was fucked up and tainted everything and everyone around him.

No reason to not have a cigarette then.

Except. He'd just beat lung cancer. The hard way, because it didn't get much harder than ol' Nick ripping them out of your chest.

There was always the air outside for a little pollution, free of charge, so he opened his office window.

He wasn't sure what to do now. Part of him wanted a direction, part of him wanted to score some payback, but Gabriel was already paying one way or another and that left him where? Sitting in a dingy office, aimless, pondering whether to start drinking at 9 in the morning.

And then the Gates on his arms started to prickle with that feeling that there was an entity close by.That was what he got for opening a window. Windows were doors in more ways than the standard breaking and entering way. John left it open, let the humid night air waft in while he turned to put his back to the wall. Ready to use that window as a door, just in case he had to.

""Hey boss.""

The voice was startlingly familiar, as was the face and hesitant grin that appeared from the shadows.

He didn't move for a long moment, three, four heartbeats, while he wondered if it was a shape-shifter or a ghost come back to get him, or... Or if it had been malicious, he would've already been dead. Twice over.

""Chas?""

""Pretty much,"" Chas stepped forward and his reason  for lurking became clear. Wings. Big fucking angel wings, looking ruffled.

They were never white like in the pictures. Not really. The ones whose wings were white were pure, full host, not half, and the rest of them probably used spells, glamors or good old bleach. Chas's looked natural, white and grey mottled together, but John didn't reach out to touch them even if he wanted to. Didn't do much more than stare, at the wings, at Chas. ""Shouldn't you be in heaven?""

""Hey, you couldn't even get me to stay in the car, and you're a lot more scary than they are,"" Chas replied trying to sit on the edge of the desk. ""No one seemed to really cope with the fact that I don't have a compulsion to obey anyone.""

""They kicked you out?"" John moved in to steady his desk lamp as a wing edge smushed slowly into it, because that was the only thing he could think to say, like it was normal and casual and Chas was just asking to crash on his sofa for a night.

""More a case of I wandered out the door,"" Chas smirked. ""I'm too low on the ladder for anyone to give a toss y'know?. So..you need a driver?""

God.

John exhaled, tried to not let it sound as shakey as it felt coming out of his chest. ""Jesus, you're supposed to be fucking dead. That psychotic angel killed you.""

""Pretty much why I got my wings,"" Chas answered. ""And you know what? I kinda figured that if there was any poor bastard who needed a half assed guardian angel it would be you.""

Half-assed was right. He was standing too close to Chas, sliding the lamp into something like a safer position, trying to not feel the energy that was coming off of him. “I could use a full assed guardian angel, if you know someone who’s offering. I…”

Chas leaned forward and it was that same excitable grin. ""Unless you've found someone to replace me already?""

He couldn’t hold back the snort he gave. “Are you kidding? No one sane’d volunteer.”

""So you're up for an angel with a dubious sense of sanity?"" Chas replied. ""I thought you'd seen me rise anyway. Lifted from Perdition they call it.  Fancy way of saying things.""

“Well, you’d have to be insane to come back down here. With everything that happened, with everything…” That could happen again. Except that Chas had wings, wings and John didn’t know what else. Superhuman strength. Heat. Warmth when he leaned in and almost kissed him.

There is was, that look in his eyes. Totally inappropriate hero-worship. At least he had thought it was blind hero-worship but perhaps it had been something else all along. Something a little more base than Hero worship, something a little more frightening to feel coming off of an angel, even if Chas still looked like Chas, without the goofy hat. “I’m not barking up the wrong tree, am I?”

""No."" Chas' smile was dazzling and he looked like an angel should, lit up with something in his face rather than the ass-holish arrogance of the others. ""You have the Sight for the",candidate00002
"doors open.""

It sounded so much more bitter and acrimonious than any argument he and Molly ever had. There was the silent treatment, slammed doors, and then she'd sneak up behind him when he was smoking on the porch, and lay her head on his shoulder. Easy as that, enough to get either of them to apologize for whatever the hell it was. ""I know that saying 'I'm sorry' right now doesn't mean a thing. But I wish you hadn't had to go through that to end up here.""

Jim smiled a little. ""Yeah. Thanks. It's Ellie that I regret. I don't regret anything else, but I regret what it did to her.""

 

Of course he would. Jim didn't talk about Ellie much but he had a picture in his wallet. Most of the department didn't even know there was an Ellie. ""When she's an adult, hopefully she'll understand what happened.""

Jim shook his head. ""I doubt it. Janice will have put the blame on me, I know that much. She doesn't think I know but... well, I found out and that was the beginning of the end. I never had a daughter, Gil. Not really. And I was so wounded by that I let it drive me away from the nearest thing... right up to Vegas.""

""You never had a daughter?"" Gil frowned for a moment, and of course reality followed shortly after the thought. ""She wasn't yours.""

""That's right. My best friend Mike, on the force."" Jim shrugged again. ""Who incidentally I turned in along with a load of other Jersey cops for playing dirty. But by then, there was nothing left there for me, you know?""

""And when there's nothing left, there's nothing to do but move on."" Gil's mouth twitched a little as he looked down at the book he'd been reading. Jim called it shit, but it was something popular he'd picked up to keep himself busy while Gil had been spending most of his time sleeping. As far as crime novels went, Gil had read better in reports, but it was amusing to nitpick it in his head. ""I ended up out here because this is where Jack helped me set up.""

""Don't tell me that,"" Jim replied. ""I don't need a reason to be grateful to Jack. I'll tell you something, in Jersey? He would have had a mysterious accident pretty quickly.""

""It's a shame we weren't up a little further north instead of in Maryland."" Gil rubbed at his temple. ""I couldn't ever hurt Jack. I've just been tempted occasionally. It was my fault for agreeing to take the jobs.""

""Like you really had a choice,"" Jim said poking a knife into his vegetables to see how long they needed. ""Let me guess it was like a scene out of... one of those movies Archie always goes on about. Help us, Gil, you're our only hope! What are you meant to say to that? No? I'm taking time out from saving lives?""

""I was,"" Gil shrugged. ""I was working as a coroner. I managed to dodge him at work, but he caught up with me at home. It was... he showed me pictures of the two families. When they were alive."" Emotional manipulation, but Jack was good for a reason. That was what Jack did. ""The deal was that he was going to protect me. I should have known better by then. But you can still be young and stupid at thirty.""

""Yeah, look at Sanders,"" Jim grinned a little. ""I still reckon that Crawford is lazy. From what I hear, our guys are managing to piece things together.""

""How's that lazy?"" Gil glanced up at Jim, watching that grin. He was glad that even if he was there being a problem, Jim could at least still smile. ""He came in, stirred everyone up, and they're doing his work for him. That's creative.""

""He never has to do it himself. Because he has a 'King Cobra' to take the chances for him,"" Jim replied. ""You on the other hand, never ask something of one of your team that you wouldn't do or haven't done yourself.""

""Neither would you."" He'd always liked that about Jim. He didn't demand the impossible, just that things be done right the first time. Gil leaned his chin on one hand. ""Did he explain why they called Will that?""

""Not in so many words."" The way he looked at Gil asked for the explanation though. ""You want to tell me?""

 

Jim should have guessed that if Gil were unwilling to explain, he wouldn't have brought it up. It was more reminiscing than he'd done",candidate00002
".

Inexorably my mind turned to the times I had encountered him before. Each time he had conspired not only to commit treason, but somehow to save lives. The notions were contradictory, but somehow appropriate. And true, I knew they were true regardless of the politics of it.  ""How did you meet him?"" There was no question who 'him' was.
 ""After I was... discharged from the Army, and I discovered what had happened to my sister in my absence, I made some reckless and foolish decisions."" He gave me a thin smile. ""I believed that making enough of a disturbance would draw attention to the problem. Unfortunately it drew only attention to myself. Sherlock, despite his own state saved me from some of the darker agents of the Crown. From that moment, I had a purpose."" 
Treason. And attempting to save people from the fate of his sister, as if what had happened to her could not be undone. ""And an ally. It's a shame you can't redeem yourself somehow. You're talented enough.""

""I am redeeming myself,"" he answered. ""In my eyes at least.  We are a conquered people. No, to them we are not even people, we are...livestock. I can speak the heresy without flinching now because I have seen the truth of it that they conceal many times over and with my death, I have made arrangements for evidence to find it's way to every major newspaper in the civilised world. If Rache is not dead, then perhaps I can leave him a legacy of revolution to return to.""

""To what end? When a herd goes mad, a smart farmer slaughters them."" Sebastian took a swig of his beer, and leaned back again. ""What does one do when the very air fights you? When they walk among us?""

""To find out how to fight them, you would have to wait for that publication,"" he said and exhaled. ""I would not create that level of risk without the possibility of success.""

No, perhaps he would not and it made me intrigued somehow when I had considered myself beyond curiosity. ""How will you know if anyone will act on it?"" I leaned forward, elbows on the table, and tracked the motion of his eyes with my own, looking for un-surety, darting.

""I do not. Every man works to his own conscience,"" he answered. ""Perhaps it will all be for nothing but I will have tried."" His gaze was steady and honest and filled with something I could not name. Regret perhaps, or a wistfulness that this was the way things were.

""You're afraid it won't work."" He wasn't, but I felt like challenging him. ""You should be there to see this through, but you don't want to see the consequences if it fails.""

""I'm not sure I want to see the consequences if it succeeds,"" he answered. ""And yourself, what is your history with Moriarty?""

""Medical discharge after Afghanistan. I shouldn't have survived at all. He needed… a foil more than someone to help with the price of the flat. We were a well matched fit, and after Victoria Gloriana healed my arm, it eased many of my concerns."" I had many doubts and fears and concerns, but I kept them close to my chest and had since my early days in the service.

""There are some of the Old Bloods who could do that,"" the doctor agreed. ""I was concerned he might try something similar again as to using you for expediency.""

""I suppose the opportunity never came up again."" I noted it wryly. ""We never spoke of it again, and he was forgiven for his failure. If I had known…"" I still cannot say if I would have gone along with it, but I felt the outrage and betrayal fresh in my heart reflecting on the memory.

""You should not have been in that position. Or what happened the last time we were here. He used you then to lure the Hound.""

I scoffed quietly, looking down at our empty plates, and hailed the barman for another round. ""I knew what I was doing with the Hound. I'd hunted foul creatures before my discharge, and I knew what baited them best.""

""It nearly had you,"" he reminded me. ""You were lucky.""  ""Luck had nothing to do with it. And your Rache, I'm sure he put you at risk for the cause."" It was hard to imagine that Rache had not been as obsessed as James had been in those last few weeks.

""Mmm."" His non-committal utterance was as much as a confirmation as I needed. It seemed both of us had issues with our companions. It was only after the drink had been brought and the other man had doggedly drunk down half of it that he said quietly. ""Did you love him?""

A more damning question had seldom been asked; still, for those who know me, and had known James, it",candidate00002
"hey, perhaps he'd like to test that authority out on him...

Well, that was an interesting thought right there.

Alistair lay back on his bedroll and drowsily fantasized. They were the last two, who better to turn to? He would broach the subject one night by the fire. Maybe he'd take him a rose. No, no he'd laugh. He didn't want people to laugh like that at him.

He didn't really expect to wake up to a dark shadow in the tent, darker than the dull dark of the campfire, a moving shadow, and he would've yelled -- loudly, in a manly fashion of course -- if there hadn't been a hand over his mouth.

There might have bit of a manly flail, because even when he realized who it was from the gleam of long blond hair and the exotic facial tattoos, this was not a particularly comforting thought. The Antivan was an assassin and this easy come easy go attitude to loyalty, it wasn't something he could get his head around. There was only one reason Zevran could have to be in his tent and that was to kill him!

""Shhh, shh, no need to cause a ruckus…"" Zevran was lying down on top of him, and oh god he was going to smother him.

""Mmph!"" Alistair managed which was actually in his head 'Zevran what by all the hells are you doing? Oh Maker, don't cut off anything I might need!'

""Shhhh. I only want to… test my skills."" He finally moved his hand off of Alistair's mouth.

""Pardon me if I don't find that particularly reassuring,"" Alistair hissed back in a bare whisper, ""Because last I heard your skills were as an  assassin.""

""Yes, and I pick locks as well. I have been thinking of your particular lock here. And can you blame me?"" It didn't surprise Alistair when Zevran put a hand over his groin.

""Oh, hey, whoa, well that's interesting."" He could throw Zevran, he out-massed him, but right now he was paralyzed by the touch over that area. ""Uh, you know, it's a magic lock and I know you keep telling everyone you've got magic fingers and, you know, offering back rubs and any type of rub you think you can get, but... Templar lock.""

""All the more reason I want to try to get through it,"" Zevran drawled. ""How long has it been, uhm?""

""How do you even know about it?"" Alistair asked belatedly. Zevran was fiddling with it. That caused all sorts of interesting sensations as the cage around his cock suddenly felt very constrictive and... nice.

""I've watched you. Luridly I might add. It's very easy, to watch you."" The edge of his mouth was curling up wickedly.

""Well watching is one thing and... Uh, what you're doing there is something else!"" Alistair's voice rose a little. ""You know, I do have my virtue and, well uh..."" It did seem a little ridiculous now he came to say it aloud.

""Your virtue. Yes, I have considered that. It would be an honor to take it from you."" Like his virginity was so much as picking a pocket!

""Yes, but..."" Alistair began. ""Do I get a choice in this? Or is this how you get your reputation? I thought you were too busy watching Wynne's bosom. You talk about it often enough. She must be three times your age and you're still flirting.""

""She's a very buxom woman,"" Zevran shrugged. ""Wise as well, and wise old buxom women still enjoy hearing that they have nice bosoms. Particularly when it's true."" In with the chatter, he was definitely stroking his hand around the magicked metal.

""Uh, look, not that what you're doing doesn't stir up some interest down there, but it's not comfortable interest and you can't break the lock. I'd rather not have a night of compressed balls, so..."" Alistair paused as he looked at what Zevran's fingers were actually doing. ""Wow, that's uh... well, how do your fingers move like that?

""Years of work. Excuse me, I have to see what I'm doing as well as feel it."" Then Zevran was sliding down his body and oh, his mouth was far too close to Alistair's trapped and now trying to get free cock.

This was pretty much what they had been completely forbidden to do. Messed with the training, the Templars said. Couldn't knock out a Mage's magic without it. No one had explained why and let's face it, he was a warrior now. Losing that ability didn't seem a bad trade from the way that Zevran was fondling his cock, pressing deep against the tight fitting cage. He wasn",candidate00002
"a madhouse, or still in the pits in Afghanistan. I leave that decision to you dear reader, as if you read this account, then surely I am real as the words on the page. The figure in the chair moved, a bare inclination of his head.

""Sebastian, I see I calculated your return correctly,"" he said and with those simple words my doubt was removed, but also the breath from my lungs as surely as if I had been struck. His eyes were bright, and glittering in the firelight and his mouth quirked in the manner that I instinctively knew meant to be his version of great humor, or perpetrating a wonderful jest.

My filthy pack was set on the ground and I have no recall of putting it there myself, nor of making any other sensible movement, though clearly I did these things unbidden by my conscious thoughts. ""How?"" It encompassed so many questions which danced in my mind.

""Calculating your return? A mere calculation of factors, and habits,"" James replied. “But of course you mean my presence. A mystery for the ages indeed. Some things are best left that way."" he said with infuriating evasiveness.

It was ever his way, and I wondered if it was due to the Queen's trust of him. Not out of reverence but out of wanting to keep a plaything alive.

 ""Are you...?"" Still human I wanted to ask though I don't know if he ever was on the same level as myself and other ordinary folk.

""Intact? Yes."" It was not an answer to the question I wanted to ask but it sufficed. 

It encapsulated the major concerns, though I was not sure intact mattered much when it came to them. I edged nearer, willing my knees to bend and feet to lift, finally close enough to touch his shoulder, seeking body heat as proof.

He was solid, real and he turned his head to meet my gaze and for the briefest moment I was convinced I saw an iridescence much like light on the carapace of a beetle shimmer over the black center of his eye.  James was returned but not unchanged unless it was my own mind giving me visions.

""I am real Sebastian, and I might be somewhat changed, but I am still your companion James Moriarty.""

""I know what they did to me. I've seen what happened to other soldiers."" Gibbering didn't always mean a ruined mind from my experience but sometimes something possessed by horror. Sometimes I'd suspected that something of the others, of royalty, had come back in the person and been incapable of using the body appropriately.

He looked at me for a long moment. ""Their realm breaks the ordinary mind Sebastian. Perhaps it is to that you owe your survival as you are far beyond the normal soldier. I attribute my own survival to my extraordinary mind. There is so much I know now Sebastian, so much!"" His face was paled and his eyes burned fanatically in darkened sockets, but I had seen him that way many times when upon a case and to my shame, the shock of his presence blinded me to some of the signs.

Here was a dead man sitting in front of me, animated and speaking, his physical mannerisms as they had ever seemed to be. ""Do you know what is going on here?”

""Yes. And it is far bigger than you can comprehend Sebastian,"" he replied. ""Sit, you are quite pale with shock.""

It was odd for him to attempt to comfort me, after all over a year missing. ""I've been out there killing these things as they encroach on us,"" I countered, because just then I needed no tender ministrations. I needed physical proof, I needed to be surer of what was before my eyes, and what my ears were hearing.

""Then tell me what you have surmised so far,"" he said gesturing again to the chair opposite him.

Reluctantly I took my place across from him, watching his eyes all the while. ""Royals not our own are encroaching on our lands. Known ones, named ones that have been foretold of in ancient histories. The King in Yellow is dead, as are more, acts sanctioned by Victoria herself.""

It was a simple way to describe the events, but accurate in my opinion.

""Indeed. And like the proverbial tip of the tentacle, that is all we see,"" James said. He leaned forward. ""Now imagine if you can how the Royals and the Sleeping Ones truly go to war. This is but the opening arguments, your previous wars a spillover of discontent from That Place to here.""

Truly, the suggestion changed nothing of my outlook -- as a soldier and a patriot. ""And?""

""Before we have been toys and playthings. Insignificant or cherished pets at best. Now we have proven a threat. Victoria Gloriana rises meteoric and old alliances shift and collapse, feeding grounds move and with it treaties crumble,"" James recited it with an edge in his voice, hysteria or mania I did not know, all the more chilling for his calm. ""War comes to Albion on",candidate00002
"form of charm.

Someone from before, old memories, times he had yielded back to their keepers, their holders, until he had been free again. It threatened to weigh on him, but he leaned in, keeping a hand on the edge and a close balance of himself as he put his face through the gate.

""Now that..."" a voice said that he recognized all too well. ""...took even less time than I thought. You must be bored Lucifer.""

A figure, a being coalesced together, coming to a point of existence not far in front of him.

""That depends on your perception of time."" Not standing outside of creation, but within it. His coup, in so many ways, the creator at once beyond and simultaneously less than his Father. ""You called me.""

""Yeah."" Elaine stood there, wearing the same form as he remembered before she had become God. ""I thought I would see how you are doing out here swimming around in the primordial soup.""

He slipped through a little further, perched between the void and her side of the gate, her creation. ""Swimmingly. And you, creator?"" Part of him hoped that she held true to what she has learned, still, though he did not know how much 'time' had passed.

There was just a moment of expression in her eyes that he recognized from the days when things had been so simple and she had just been a girl accidentally getting involved with him for simple reasons. ""That's a bit formal. I still think of myself as Elaine.""

He contemplated his words, because the heaviness of lack of time was on his side, watching her expression. She, too, had experienced the slowing of it, and the pulls and sharp tugs at the same time. He wondered what it felt like for the endless to traipse through her being, her creation. That was a question he'd never had answered. ""Good. It suits you.""

""I have to have something that is just me,"" Elaine said with a faint smile.  She remained loitering on the threshold with him. ""Look at you. How have you been?""

Like a doting family member. ""Traveling. Seeing what there is to see.""

""And what is there to see in the Void?"" she asked. He could feel the sharp vibrancy of existence wrapped around her.

Like a living thing, completely interwoven with her. She embraced that power, in a way Michael had long abandoned. He let the sensation wash over him, let it tingle his senses in a way emptiness hadn't. ""Nothing.""

""Mmm. Have you had your fill of emptiness?"" she said with a hint of wry irony.

 He made a noncommittal noise as he leaned slightly further into her creation. ""The grass is greener."" He had forgotten the intensity of things rather than the half formed potentialities. There were things out there that moved in the darkness. Strange things, the nightmares of insane gods, the ruins of universes abandoned to the gnawing parasites of entropic heat death.

He had looked and stopped and observed and let it pass, let it all pass, or they had let him pass, and that was the question. What next and what now, and the dizzying sensation of a familiar creation curling at the edges of his senses. ""I would be an aberration to your creation.""

She looked at him with those eyes there were at once the creators' and that of the twelve year old girl who had accidentally summoned the Devil. ""No, you wouldn't,"" she said simply. ""How could you be?""

There was no role for him to fill, for he had passed those burdens on to better actors. It was a freedom, in its own way, to be beyond those stages and requirements. ""That is perhaps a question you don't want to ask.""

""I do and I have,"" Elaine asked and smiled.""You are always welcome in this creation. You are no aberration Lucifer.""

He had watched it unfold from a position, if not the exact time, and felt the tug of experience, memories and past which he had not been willing to yield to his father. The scar was his, his past, his decisions, still his. ""I will leave again, after a while."" He kept a hand on the edge of the door, but curiosity beckoned him further.

""You think someone always has an ulterior motive don't you?"" Elaine said by way of an answer. ""Plans within plans, within ever convoluted plans.""

What he had learned  from Yahweh, his Father. From his brother.

He felt the smile touch his face as he looked out across her creation, and then to her again. ""Perhaps, perhaps not. Perhaps I know I will be restless again.""

""That's okay,"" she said. ""I just wanted you to know you have a Home."" Such a simple innocent powerful statement. Even his own Creation had not truly felt like home. He had never been entirely sure why.

Perhaps because of schemes and plans",candidate00002
"ll turn up here again, okay?""

""Got it, Dad. I promise to stay in touch."" Greg hesitated as they reached the doorway even as his mother moved forward to hug him and kiss him. The flinch was hidden this time and he managed to accept her contact and concern.

""Take care of yourself, Greg, sweetie,"" she said as she straightened up. ""And of Gil, too.""

Greg nodded. ""That we definitely agree on.""

""It was good to meet you both, though I wish it hadn't been under these circumstances."" Gil stood up, shadowing Greg to the door before he offered both of them a hand shake.

Pete shook his hand with a firm grip, and Rane treated him to a hug as well much to everyone's astonishment. 

""You make sure you take care of yourself as well, Gil,"" she said even as she stepped back. ""You've got our numbers, Greg's got our e-mail. You let us know anything.""

""We will."" Gil wasn't quite sure what 'anything' entailed, but it sounded like she wanted to hear any news, good or bad. Gil stepped back to stand beside Greg in the doorway. ""Have a safe trip back home.""

The watched as Greg's parents left, Greg finally pushing the door shut as their car pulled away.

""I shouldn't be glad they're gone but... Jesus, I don't think I could deal with them being around. Congratulations, Gil, you've survived a visit from my mother.""

There was something about the tone of Greg's voice, something about the texture of his words, and while Gil couldn't pick up what it was, he could tell it was there. He shifted closer, slid an arm over Greg's shoulder and then slowly, a little awkwardly embraced him. ""So did you.""

Greg turned into him and leaned, ""She doesn't mean it. She never means it. She just has this uncanny way of saying exactly the wrong thing..."" he mumbled into him. ""Usually it doesn't matter, I don't care but... oh god, Gil, do you think the same? That it's like me raping you, having my child forced on you?""

The leaning felt good, and he could feel Greg's words more than he heard them. He moved fingers, a little awkward still, and rubbed down Greg's back. ""No. I'm... grateful that it is yours, actually. That it wasn't one of them. If they hadn't kept saying that it was yours, I...""

Greg was holding him as well and he could feel as well as hear the sigh of relief at that. ""We were a good match, they said. I... god, it wears me out dealing with Mom. I love her and Dad, but even at the best of times, I spend forever afterwards as some sort of wreck. You were great. And I'm really glad you weren't horrified at the thought it was mine.""

The thought that it was there at all was so much more pressing than worrying over whose it was, but Gil didn't say that. He just nodded, and finally started to back up towards the sofa. ""You're smart, bright, and ambitious, you like to learn, and you worry about people. You'll make a good father."" A better father than Gil himself, but there wasn't any sense in saying that, either

""So will you,"" Greg said as he eventually sat on the couch. He looked directly at Grissom. ""You're not going to leave this all to me, you know."" He smiled a little at him but his expression was worried and more than a little serious.

""I hope not,"" Gil shrugged casually, one arm still around Greg as they settled down, side-by-side, leg against leg. ""I just... the way you've reacted helps me. I'm glad you came here.""

""Even with the woods rescue and the parents from hell?"" Greg grinned a little. ""Well, with any luck, we got my obstacles out of the way, so we get to concentrate on you now.""

If Greg thought they were going to deal with just one person at a time, he was insane. Gil leaned in a little more, peering at Greg's shifting eye movements. ""We can both concentrate on getting better and coping.""

""You get closer, Griss, and I might just have to kiss you again,"" Greg said almost nervously. ""It's like a reaction I have.""

""Closeness bringing about some strange kissing reaction?"" Gil didn't move, shift forward or backwards. ""We could test it scientifically, but I'm not sure what the control would be.""

Greg shifted just a little closer to him. ""Tell me no and I'll back off,"" he said",candidate00002
"approached me now.

""I  would not take arms against you, son of Arathorn,"" I told him quietly  when he had at last stopped several feet beyond my spot. ""My enemy is  but the Eye, within its cold Tower, and those who serve beneath him be  it willingly or otherwise at this point. If you think it wise to draw  Andúril against me I will not oppose it, and indeed I would welcome the  touch of that legendary blade if it were otherwise so presented."" I said  quietly and firmly.

Our eyes looked upon one another and the  connection of a Soul Gaze established itself- only to be reflected, cast  aside and denied by some inner will and wellspring of strength he  possessed- no doubt the fortitude that had allowed him to throw aside  Sauron's black will when he looked upon the Palantir properly some weeks  from now.

He drew the hilt out a few inches without flinching,  though I couldn't exactly say the same, as I blinked and leaned back in  surprise; it felt like the utter denial that the Guardian Angel serving  beneath Uriel had performed, when I chose to see it with my Wizards  Sight.

""You may have tried to conquer my spirit, Istari,""  he stated softly as the blade rose further still, ""but I have taken it  unto myself and reversed your spell; and lo! I have seen some glimpse of  what you are, and of what you represent. You are not of Arda, not  wholly, and nor would I claim you to be that which you state; but I have  seen the Vala you proclaim and in him is the fire of Ilúvatar. To what  reasons you have come are not clear to me- but I am assuaged of your  intentions to aide the Fellowship,"" he said slowly.

I exhaled in  relief and smiled loosely before he drew the sword in full, and Andúril  sliced a thin line across my left cheek while my guard was down. I  hissed lowly as the absurdly sharp edge bit through my gathered flesh  and spilled faint dews of blood across the grass.

He stared a  moment more before sheathing his sword and leaning down, gripping my  right hand and drawing me back to my feet. ""Rise, Dresden the Black,"" he  intoned. I gripped my staff and drew it upright as well, recognizing  the reason for his action even if it burned irritably, and I shuffled my  staff to the crook of one elbow so that I could press the same hand  against my cheek.

""Look and see, my companions! This battle has  been fought and the stranger bleeds as truly as you and I, were we dealt  such a cut. What suspicions as I held are allayed at this moment, and I  ask that you as well set them aside ere we go forward."" Aragorn called  back to the other two.

End of Chapter Two.

Things become tenser still between Dresden the Black and the Fellowship.

Boromir stood firm as Aragorn and I approached, suspicion not only present in the hard lines of his face, but outright scorn. ""Hail I say to you, son of Denethor and Glóin, thrice and for all this morrow,"" I said at once, lingering not long upon the man's distrust for instead I felt it right to kneel and present myself for the dwarf's approval.

Boromir could be checked by the Dunedain at my side, and they had passed through Gimli's long forsaken homeland only to find it in ruination and flame, host to an evil that few are aware of in modern times. An injustice if ever there were one, and Gandalf had given his life to see the Fellowship to safety. For that alone I could not hold myself back.

""To what fate has done to you and yours in Moria long behind, I offer condolences and more, for I have it not only in my power to fix, mayhap, but only the pressing matter of time that denies my offer to you now."" Gimli's stony features could have chiseled yet further, almost to match the man beside him, and I spoke thus, ""Yet when we've the freedom, when this journey has seen itself through to the very end, I offer you my aide as Istari in this further venture, son of Glóin: Moria shall be renewed. If it does not gleam as the white walls of the White City, I offer you my staff and knowledge to make it so ere I wander back from Arda, be thus in yonder months or many years. Your home shall be renewed!""

I could but feel the sneer which graced good Boromir's expression next. Indeed, his words were not to be unexpected, given such a vast and terrible claim. I might of as well have sworn to march forward into Mordor and tear down the black tower of Barad-dur with my own hands.

""For pity's sake,"" he exclaimed, ""do you not see the silver tongue that flashes in the light? Do you not hear the honeyed lies clear as this winding horn I carry?""

Gimli met my gaze without flinching. He buried his axe in the ground between us with a mighty huff. ""How my heart longs for",candidate00003
"meter in just seconds. In under a minute he stepped back from an arching tent as tall as he and just as wide as their camels meandering nearby.

""Ladies first.""

He gestured her in with a hand on the opening, pulling back the thick fold. Miss Carnahan peered in warily. The next moment she made a little noise of delight mixed with wonder in the back of her throat that did very interesting things for his libido, though he squashed the initial stirring before it bloomed into something harder to wrangle under control.

""As I said, ma'am, more than enough rooms, and all the comforts I pegged you for needing, full bedroom and bath, stocked kitchen, even a small library next to the common room to help with your inquiries. Unfortunately no wireless seems to pick up a signal where we'll be going in the weeks ahead, if my experiences in deserts and old magic are anything to go by.""

He let her enter and stepped back, fiddling with his satchel of ropes dumped carelessly to the sand. While far more simple he had no need to enjoy the luxury or accommodations of a team-class dwelling. She poked her head back out to stare at him with a good deal less animosity. ""Aren't you coming in?"" she asked.

""No ma'am. Wouldn't want the crew to get suspicious,"" he said good-naturedly. Then he tugged a rope end and his workman's tent began compiling like a set of dominoes falling into place, popping into position at knee-height. Unlike her own, his truly was a simple thing, only a little wider within than the size without. He shrugged his way in and sighed when his head met the make-due pillow of a rolled up rug.

He heard her footsteps coming around the end and then she was kneeling by his boots and looking at him incredulously. ""Surely you cannot be comfortable in that, Mr. Weasley.""

He yawned behind one hand. ""If I worried about comfort, Miss Carnahan, I wouldn't be a curse breaker. Don't forget to zip the opening before you turn in. Good morning."" He tucked his feet in and toed the opening closed before her nose, letting his mind drift to a place of quiet contemplation.

""Ooh!"" Her protest brought a rough grin to his lips.

Their journey ticked by on the calendars kept by Bill and the leading goblin, Cthukuk, who finally deigned to speak with him on the eighth night. Unfortunately for them both, that happened to be the point by which he'd put together a reasonable understanding of where and when his life, and by association Miss Carnahan's, would be forfeit; when they finally closed toward her fabled Hamunaptra. And the stars in conjunction with the analysis of her map were leading them fairly true.

""We are nearing, wizard.""

Cthukuk's voice in English felt as comforting as a Banshee's opening wail. Given his run in with two over the course of his life to date, and Fleur in full-on Veela wrath did not count, Bill resisted the urge to wince with a surprising degree of success.

""I was beginning to think the same,"" he answered obliquely.

Cthukuk gave him no other warning. No sinister, premeditated chuckle. No whistle to coordinate with the others nearby. Not even the swish of a hitherto-concealed dagger rising from the folds of a thrown-back cloak. The goblin simply pointed and the rune-encrusted rings around his swollen index finger spat a wave of invisible force against the body of Hannibal, his camel.

Bill had known to expect something, but kinetic energy was not one of the areas he had prepared for. Hannibal went down in an explosion of blood and fur, sending Bill himself into a headlong tumble that he barely turned into a halted roll back toward his beloved mount for a fraction of protection.

Nearby Miss Carnahan screamed. The other goblins split their numbers, two more encircling his position to flank him, the remainder going after her. In an instant a sense of protective duty reared up inside of his admittedly shaken head.


Bugger this!


A thin brass flute materialized in Bill's right hand, loosened from the holster around his upper arm. There was barely enough time to raise it to his lips, and even before he made contact with the tip he was breathing out in a seemingly nonsensical rush. The first silver rings surrounding him hummed as a volley of force raced forward, throwing bits of camel and desert sands skyward. Then a piercing wail rose up on the wind from every corner at once, a tone of deafening, all-pervading volume that burrowed into the ears and set up an amphitheater with no way out. The goblins by instinctive nature snarled in Gobbledygook and clapped their burnished fingers against their ears, while beneath them the orcneas bellowed as if being slaughtered, thrashing their leathery heads from side to side; thick spurts of metallic green blood splashed across the desert floor. Gone insensate with pain the mad mounts charged head-long into each other, crazed with agony.

"they were behaving like good little servants to Mab's ironclad-will compared to that?
Hindsight response; it matters a whole damn lot, that's what.
She made her move while I was still at the 'dribble soup across my chest unless told to close my mouth and swallow' stage. Normally arctic shades of blue, green, and piercing violet were whitewashed to a nondescript flat tone throughout her hair, itself unbraided and laying lifeless around her brow and neck in a way that, even had I retained my full senses, I would have been hard-pressed to guess was the Winter Lady, the Queen-in-the-making, Maeve.
I still remember the first thing that caught my attention beyond the usual and tried to warn me away from what was to come - her eyes. Carefully concealed behind that don't-look-at-me hairdo until the door closed with all the finality of the headsman's axe. Then she tilted her head back to peer at me, with eyes that glittered of delicious satisfaction, the huntress cornering the wounded prey - in fact, no, even that does not convey the measure of her gaze upon my form in proper truth. I'm being far too generous to my own unstable position back then.
Her look said, in no uncertain terms, that I was a drowning man half-way down the whirlpool, clinging desperately to a strip of wood as the sky roared with thunder and sleet and the waves crashed down relentlessly from above. And she was just the latest force of unforgiving nature falling from on high to snuff my pitiful existence from the world. It said I was a dead man no matter what happened next, coasting along on borrowed time before the inevitable end, and that I could choose to let go and be dragged down by the current or smashed to tinder like the driftwood holding me afloat.
And would you like to know what I did in response to that deadly gaze? I'd love to say I sat up straight, gave her the finger, and vanished back to Chicago with a well-placed aparturum and witty remark to remember me by. I'm sure some part of my brain was desperately firing on all cylinders with the explicit orders to do just that, which turned to frothing at the metaphorical mouth as I just lay there paralyzed with cold terror instead.
My tongue went drier than it already had been. A vicious sweat broke out across my forehead and palms, hair standing on edge from the neck down, and my breath came in slow and painfully clenched exertions.
""Oh, my Knight,"" she cooed in a mocking tribute to Mab, ""my poor, poor Knight, whatever shall you do?"" She strode forward and laid the platter with my chicken broth to one side of the bed, stretched out a section of sheet beside my left hip, and sat down rather more primly than her attitude and look promised she could do. I flinched just from proximity to her and those unrelenting eyes.
""Why ever do you tremble so?"" she asked in a sort of sing-song tone perfectly at odds with her expression.
When I did not answer Maeve reached out to the bowl and swept a spoonful up to her own lips, which parted just enough to take the fluid in, and then without swallowing or spilling a drop she leaned forward to press them against my own. A shudder of pure chill raced down my body from the point of contact straight to my toes, plush though those lips were against my own courser finish. Her tongue darted out to part mine and in a disgusting take on the French kiss, or maybe the snowball depending on your savviness, she tilted her head down enough to pass the now-cold broth between us in one slow motion. Her tongue roved out and wrestled mine down with no effort until the last transfer of fluids was completed.
I felt the quirk in her mouth as she smiled and pulled back, one hand rising to swipe away the trail of saliva cooling into frost between our mouths, the other coming up beneath my chin to close my mouth before I dribbled across the sheets.
""Swallow."" She ordered without a trace of her former pleasant tones.
I swallowed, and even had the good sense to open again without being told. I couldn't tell why she was doing this, but looking back I recognize how much satisfaction she was reaping from the oral rape.
She repeated the process once, twice, thirty times. However many it took to empty the bowl, and all the while the only thing I felt was terrified urges to obey and please the inhuman thing before me. The clamor that had erupted across my flesh at her presence had since gone on to leave me shivering from the lump of half-frozen soup sluicing back and forth in my gut.
""Mm, so cold. We mustn't let the Winter Knight freeze to death."" She pressed me down into the bedding and for a long moment I feared she would climb atop and smother me. Instead she drew the blankets up to my chin and used that as an excuse to lean in and press her",candidate00003
".

The Third righted that matter with the end of a rigid pole. Just as two months earlier, lighting his pipe so quickly that Naruto could not even read the hand seals, so too did the Hokage move like the wind in striking down each remaining Iwa-nin that closed in on them, smashing the bodies to the ground only to fling them skyward the next instant in a blur of precision. In a handful of beats sixteen men came crashing to the hard land, unconscious.

The last, the commander of the strike team, watched from a measured distance. ""Iwa remembers,"" he bit out hotly, and before the stretching staff could reach him, the man leveled the earth upwards beneath their feet and the wagon where the Third and the merchant stood, and then he was gone underground.

In the aftermath of the surprise assault, the Third sent his walking, talking staff to finish bringing the scroll merchant on into Iwa proper, and issued a return to Konoha for the rest of them while the evening hours still burned red on the horizon. Naruto complained loudly about being sent home without seeing the mission through to its completion, but he quelled soon enough before the Third's stare.

""'least we got to use our kenjutsu sommat,"" he muttered under his breath to his teammates. Kiba was less enthused, but it was Ino who seemed to be downright shaken by her contributions in the act of death. Naruto could, for once, sympathize. Mizuki's demise had not been a pleasant introduction to the real side of the ninja arts awaiting them down the road.

They reached the gates of Konoha by sunrise of the second morning following the incident. Unknown to his students, the Third Hokage had sat watch while they slept fitfully each time they bedded down for the night, thoughts too full to sleep even had he not been intent on seeing Team Sarutobi returned to Konoha safely.

Naruto frowned. ""So what do we do in the meanwhile?""

""What else? Train. There's no guarantee anyone will be nominated.""

And on that ominous note, one week later, the same Jōnin came around to break the news; ""Sorry to say it, but Lord Hokage can not in good faith nominate Team Sarutobi for this year's Chuunin Exams. Better luck next time.""

A cold stone sank down Naruto's gullet and settled into place amidst his ramen noodles. Kiba and Akamaru pitched a fit, complaining about the man hours spent working together for nothing this year, while Ino rolled her eyes and left without a word.

""But… but we worked so hard!"" Naruto finally said to the silver haired man. ""We even fought off those Iwa shinobi! The Old Man's been drilling us fiercely for over two months! What more does he want?""

The Jōnin stared at him with a curious expression. ""Sometimes your skill and dedication just aren't enough to cut it, kid. Lord Hokage's decision is final. There's always next year.""

Below, Sasuke, of course, because who else but the prestigious bastard of the Uchiha clan, was fighting another genin from Suna and holding his own against the barrage of sand attacks.

Naruto squinted at his Academy rival and secretly hoped to see him beaten to a bloody pulp, but what were the odds of that actually happening? So far, slim to none. Red eyes aglow, Sasuke was countering every attack thrown his way, and landing a handful of his own in retribution.

After twenty minutes Naruto gave up and stood up, working back from the crowd into the rest of the Academy and then into the village center. I could really go for about ten bowls of Teuchi's tastiest, spiciest ramen right now, he lamented. I'll even settle for the fish roe ramen.

He never got the chance.

The village lit up like a bonfire, as throughout, ten infiltrators set into motion Konoha's destruction and the taking of the hidden beasts pooled together.

""Naruto!"" Ino was the first to reach him after the explosions stopped, finding the other blond half buried in a pile of debris. Naruto grunted as he crawled out from beneath a shattered wall, bleeding from half a dozen small but irritable wounds. He wiped a torn sleeve across his brow and held his arm there to stem the flow from reaching his eyes.

""Oh kami, Naruto, it's awful! We need to find Kiba!""

""What the hell happened?""

""I don't know!""

A man stepped out from the shadows behind them, an older, harrowed, sterner copy of Sasuke. Naruto stared at him blankly, briefly wondering how the bastard had grown over a foot and when did his Sharingan start bleeding from the tear ducts, when the longest three days of the young ninja's life came crashing down upon him in a reign of horrible fire and memories of torture, the Iwa battle gone catastrophically wrong.

Ino screamed when her teammate collapsed bonelessly, shivering, to the ground. When the darker Sasuke turned his bleeding gaze upon her she hit him with all the oomph of her Shintenshin no Jutsu",candidate00003
"a double handful of ash and nearly dead embers from the silent fireplace burned to its last, and set it down atop the girl's bedding. The sparks leapt and fell with only a bit of encouragement from his breath. In no time at all a crackling flame danced wickedly about the surface and spread toward whatsoever it could find.

Satisfied that the room would soon be in cinders, he checked to be sure the boy was still alive. Tiny lungs drew in breath and expelled it, even as the eyes were shut tight. He ripped a long strip from the girl's skirt and wrapped the last Potter heir in it rather than keep the old banner, then placed the tiny boy into a fold sewn into his cloak near the back. It was already filled with small ointments to slow blood loss and sooth pain, but as he had no need of such yet, he dumped them out upon the table to make room. The boy fit just-so inside.

""This will be a hard life, child. I hope for both our sakes that I can lie as well as I think I can."" The smoke filling the space began to make it hard to breath as it doubled back upon itself, and so he wrenched open the door again, paused to throw his now-useless ointments upon the blaze, and stepped out into a new future, for House Black as well as House Potter.

The son of a Ser.


Harry


""Come, lad, at it again!"" Harry Rivers scrambled off his wet arse before his Lord Father had even finished the taunt, hastening across the slippery slope to reclaim his hunting dagger from the shallowest stretch of riverbed. It was a small thing by the measure of full-grown men, but for a youth of just eight, it fit his palms and then some so that he had to grip it as if it were a bastard sword. Which was fitting, for he himself was a bastard.

But no such blade could claim to be even half as fine as his dagger, with its rich wine red-entwining-green leather wrapped hilt and polished, now gleaming silvered-red blade free of blemishes, untarnished despite the months of training, and a firm edge along each side perfect for peeling back fur and hide that narrowed to a wicked point well suited to stabbing. The Old Magic had tempered it long ago, according to his Lord Father, which was the only reason why he allowed the grip to hold onto the traitorous colors of House Potter alongside the velvet black-green of House Gaunt. That lustrous leather lay damp and cool from the latest bath in the stream. Harry squeezed tight, and fat droplets of water oozed out from between his fingertips to splash around his sopping wet boots.

Satisfied it wouldn't turn in his hands, Harry launched himself around the river stones of his name with a cry of determination.

Ser Sirius Black, aged eight-and-twenty, eyed the boy charging him with splashing footfalls and nimbly stepped back without a glance to the treacherous rocks passing beneath his own boot soles, smoothing down the front of his ragged shirt and yawning widely in dismissal. The long black and blunted training blade clutched in his off-hand dipped and rose with the motion.

Harry's own muddled green eyes dilated, widening at first by the casual disregard, narrowing the next beat with renewed vigor. Even so as he hopped quickly amidst the deepening pool and pull of the stream he had to turn his gaze upon each step in his way to be sure he didn't slip or turn an ankle in the numerous faults lurking beneath the surface. It had taken him two weeks to recover from the swelling the last time, to no end of mockery in the interim by his Uncle Regulus.

""I haven't all day, you know.""

Harry finally reached his Lord Father and swung widely upward, aiming for the shins or, better yet, the thighs. He couldn't yet reach the belly and he knew better than to aim for the manhood. It wasn't his place to",candidate00003
"you.

Slowly coming up to my feet, I leveled him a wary look and opened my mouth to respond. ""I'm listening. What do you want?""

I'd have phrased it nicer, but who am I kidding; I could sooner keep the insolence from my tone as the moon could refuse to rise every evening.

Khronos spared me a bland look and motioned one hand around himself slowly, and then arched an eyebrow, as if saying Out here? Are you serious?

""Yessir I am. You do not have my permission to cross my threshold until I've heard, in normal human octaves, exactly what it is that you are expecting me to perform for you yourself."" I answered his unspoken question without a drop of sarcasm- guess the moon won't be rising tonight, after all.

Something inhuman passed across his features, a flat, dark look, seeming to reshape how his face molded together.

Then it was gone and he stepped forward and across my threshold as if it was nonexistent. And it most assuredly was not, given all of the hours and days I had toiled to make sure this place was as much a home in the proper sense as any other in the world.

""Mister Dresden, despite my name and its role in history, I do not have unlimited time at my side to spare with fencing words at one another like this. The window to interfere grows smaller with every minute of time that passes forward. Do you understand me?"" He asked sharply.

I narrowed my eyes at his own tone. ""What do you want?"" I repeated.

One hand clenched into a fist, but he pressed his emotions back down under the mask he wore, and with a gesture the door at his back slammed closed again. With that done Khronos stared back at me with those too-wide pupils for several seconds, as if weighing his words before delivering them.

""As you are well aware, their is no law prohibiting transition throughout the flow of time. It is, I believe your kind views, a task deemed more or less futile due to the weight and speed with which the current runs. You would need a significant degree of opposite and surpassing strength to wade through it.""

I nodded once. A mortal wizard could, at best, and at the risk of burning their life out for it as all too many hopeless schmucks had proven throughout history, make a localized journey backwards or forwards in time to within about fifteen minutes, provided you had enough juice built up to draw upon.

It took less to speed your perception of time up or slow it down rather than try to overcome it altogether, but I could manage a jump to within a few minutes, provided Demonreach was willing to comply and supply the necessary oomph.

""Unlike you mortals, our kind have a firmer understanding. My brethren and I are more than capable of sundering the current flow and forcing it unto a separate path- which we have already done all too often. Do you understand?"" He asked.

""No."" I answered simply. His face flitted through that dark, subhuman expression again, but Mouse let out a low growl in the back of his throat, and the deity's eyes locked onto my Foo dog's for a long moment.

Then he exhaled tiredly and leaned against the steel door. I frowned.

""Say that you and yours decided to divert a river, and your first decision is to create a dam to block it. The river is soon caught up and overflowing, if done improperly, and spills back along the way that it came to some degree. Drainage ditches are created to divert some of the river aside, but a lack of attention insures that the ditch is filled to the brim before it is ready, and soon runs freely over the lay of the land. Before you can stop it, the land is flooded, taking with it so many lives, and the only choice is to destroy what is built of the dam to return the river to its natural course in the hope of releasing the land of its damage. To some degree the flood has already reentered into the empty river bed, but as the water level slowly diminishes, pockets and pools and even perhaps a lake or two are left standing behind, alone, separated. Due to the casualties already sustained, you lack the necessary force to remove these unsightly and wasteful pools, and over time, they stagnate and decay, and disease accumulates within them that spreads to the surrounding area.""

Khronos managed to say all of that without once needing to stop and breath, and I gaped at him, even as my mind processed his message and the underlying point. After a few seconds I got it. ""You're saying that time has been broken up like that?"" I asked him.

The deity nodded. ""I am alone among my kind these days, Harry Dresden. There is little enough that I may do about this as such, though I may still step upon the surface of time and trek back and forth as an observer.""

""So what happens when a..."" I struggled to wrap my",candidate00003
"the kind of salary those terms said he was willing to pay me to sign up as his hit-wizard.

Oh, I had no illusions as to what he really wanted my more-than-marginal talents for, but the contract laying there was quite circumspect in the wording.

And outside of that one little flaw, I'll admit that it felt pretty damn good thinking of what my life could be like in the nominal hours.

And yet, for every pro that I could find, the cons that came with being an wizard in this century knocked them back down a few pegs; what good was a fancier apartment or, more than likely, an actual house, if I'd just burn out the water heater and electrical systems within a day?

What could I do with a better mode of transportation if it would just breakdown and cost me a small fortune to repair? The Blue Beetle was slow and my god, was it an embarrassment to drive around in, but I could reasonably rely on it to get me there on time when it counted for what for.

No. Housing and transportation were non-factors in this equation, and the only things I could measure the potential deal in the making by were the other aspects of my life that could be impacted.

My reputation with Chicago PD's Special Investigations unit wasn't at an all time high at the moment, and what little I had regained since the Sells' incident wasn't enough to mend the fence with Karrin Murphy, which meant that I wasn't going to be looking to them for a case and the usual exorbitant-per-hour quota I used to get for my services semi-frequently.

Without that, I was already past-due on this month's rent, to say nothing of the next month's.

But even still, I could probably scrounge up something from somewhere to get through by the skin of my teeth, just as I had in the days before becoming SI's consultant.

What ultimately changed my mind about immediately rejecting Marcone's deal and telling him to shove it was the effect his name carried with it in spoken circles.

When news spread that Gentleman Johnny Marcone was coming through a section of Chicago, the rest of the criminals with two braincells to rub together took their illegal activities to another section of the town, and though I hated to admit it, he wielded his considerable political clout like a surgeon would a scalpel; in four years, he had never been successfully charged with a single case in court.

Was he innocent? Define 'innocent' in full legalese and hope your lawyer happens to speak as fluently in bullshido.

As for anyone else that was stupid enough to hang around and try to duke it out with him outside of the courts, they usually found out why Marcone had won out over the Jamaicans and Vargassi family those four years ago.

The name 'Harry Dresden', on the other hand, was typically accompanied with skeptic stares and unpleasant muttering about my hourly rates, even when I provided the services agreed to by those desperate enough to ask for my help.

And dammit if that doesn't grate on my nerves more than almost anything else in the world.

I'm trying to save lives and help the little guy out along the way, but most of the time, the little guy is too busy adamantly refusing to acknowledge reality until it takes a bite out of their head one midnight stroll to offer even common courtesy.

And that wasn't even accounting for the vast opinion of the White Council.

Even now, with the Doom of Damocles lifted at last and by their own reluctant order, I was viewed my many of my fellow and older council-members as a danger to the Council's reputation at the best of times, and a volatile threat at the worst.

Exhaling, I nodded my head.

I wouldn't sign up to help Johnny Marcone under normal circumstances.

I wouldn't want to disappoint my teacher or the views of magic he had instilled in me after helping to spare my life about a seven or eight years ago.

But there were times when he had mentioned the lesser of two evils, and if Marcone didn't put me on the tab now, than who would he turn to next?

I knew enough wizards of the White Council to know that none of them would agree, and nor would they take kindly to his trying.

More likely, he'd find another Victor Sells somewhere, easily lured in by the money and having no compunctions whatsoever about murder, and then I'd be up to my neck in bloodshed that I could have avoided.

I picked up the sheet of fine paper and scanned the terms printed there again, frowning at the lack of casual-loopholes, and picking up the pen, I scratched through two or three lines I found unappealing before setting the sheet back down and facing him.

Marcone examined them and sighed quietly beneath his breath. ""I had wondered if you would even understand the meaning behind those words, Mister Dresden,"" he said with a light condescension in his tone.

I scowled",candidate00003
"darting away. He wiped away spit – Tim's spit – from his mouth with the back of his hand and cried, almost hysterically, “What the hell is going on?!”

Tim had made this little grunt when Kon had dropped him, rolling away less gracefully than he normally would, but Kon hadn't really noticed because he'd been busy freaking out. Tim pushed himself to his feet and said, “Why did you drop me?”

“I was kissing you!”

Tim rolled his eyes. “Yes...”

“And I didn't want to!”

Now he smirked. “Didn't you though?”

“I – I - “ And he thought about it, and he did want to kiss Tim. Really badly. He wanted to kiss him and grope him and run his hand up the inside curve of Tim's muscular thigh. He wanted to know if dick tasted different then pussy, and if Tim had brought lube because he really wanted to fuck him.

“What did you do to me?!”

“I'd say that I had Warlock turn you gay...” Tim said slyly.

A horrified strangling noise made its way out of his throat.

“But then I'd have to share you so of course that's a dirty, dirty lie.”

Kon would have breathed a sigh of relief, but he found himself kissing Tim again instead.

It wasn't like Tim wasn't a good kisser. Well, he'd really only kissed Cassie, and that was pretty nice, but Tim's kisses were harder and more aggressive and full of tongue. Kon was enjoying it despite himself. When he finally managed to pull away, he hissed,

“You had Warlock put a spell on me? Why didn't you have him grow back your eye instead?!”

Tim shrugged. “I can get a cybernetic replacement for the eye. I can't get another Kryptonian fucktoy.”

“I am not going to fuck you!” Kon insisted hotly, and then realized he was firmly groping Tim's ass. It was a very nice ass.

“Aren't you? I've been carrying lube in my pocket for weeks.”

“You little shit.”

Kon tackled Tim to the ground, but instead of bashing Tim's head into the pavement, he flipped around, hitting the ground himself and Tim landing on top of him, straddling his hips. His hands were on Tim's ass and his cock was hard and aching and he was seriously pissed off. Well. He would be, if he wasn't so damn horny.

Tim hissed in pain when Kon dug his fingers into Tim's hip.

“What's wrong with you?” Kon snapped. He was the one who was suffering here, dammit.

“Got shot a couple days ago. Surprised you didn't know. You've been stalking me. Oh – were you busy rubbing one out? Will said that might happen.”

“You're such a little bitch, Drake.”

“Only for you.” Tim smirked again, and flexed his hips so they ground down onto Kon's erection. “Now fuck me. I know you want to.”

Kon thought about denying it. Just leaving Tim there and flying off and begging Cassie to at least let him eat her out if she wouldn't let him fuck her. Normally he took out his sexual frustrations on Mordred but not fucking a guy was kind of the point right now.

His TTK hadn't waited for his brain to make a decision because they were already both mostly naked when he realized that, yes, this was happening and he'd have to find a way to kill Will later but for now he was going to fuck Tim. Once that was settled, he was pulling Tim up to his mouth and swallowing Tim's cock, and yes, pussy tasted different than cock but it was still good, and all those sounds Tim was making just fueled his lust. He knew he was going to regret this later. You could sort of argue you were straight if you just fucked a guy. A hole was a hole after all. And Tim fucking him totally hadn't counted. That was under duress and fuck Owls anyways.

But once you put a guy's dick in your mouth, you were a fag and there wasn't any going back from that. Kon knew that, and somehow, as he sucked on Tim's dick, and swallowed it down his throat, he really couldn't bring himself to care.

He felt Tim tense with the beginning of an orgasm and pulled off instantly. Tim moaned, his hands gripping Kon's shoulders, his right eye half closed in pleasure while the left side of his mask stared at him blankly through white out lenses. “There is no way in hell you're coming before I do.” Kon snapped. “Where's your fucking lube?”

Tim smiled triumphantly and fished around in his utility belt. He handed the little screw top bottle to Kon, who shook his head. “You do",candidate00004
"'t remember ever having sex with you. But we – weren't we together? Or did my head fuck that up, too?/

Steve had to blink back tears. He honestly hadn't thought Bucky would remember. They'd been very discreet; it wasn't like there was much in the history books to trigger Bucky's memory.

“Yeah. Yeah we've – we were together for a long time.”

/Then why don't I remember having sex with you?/


 “Do you 

want


 to have sex with me?”





 Bucky bit his lip, like he wasn't sure what he was supposed to say. “I...


would


.”



Steve swallowed. “But do you want to?”

“I don't know Steve, half the time I don't even want to eat. Stop being edgy and just tell me what's on your mind already!”

“You're asexual Bucky. Well, I mean you were. I don't know what you are now, you're supposed to discover that for yourself. That's what Sam says.”

“I'm asexual?”

“...yeah. I um. I am too, actually. It's part of why we got together.”

“You're asexual? But you're so – everything. Everyone makes eyes at you.”

“Have you seen pictures of me before the serum? No one looked at me then. Besides, just because someone wants to have sex with me doesn't mean I'm required to oblige them.”

“I can say no,” Bucky repeated by rote. He didn't always remember what it meant.

“Yes, you can.”

“So...what did we do? If we didn't have sex? That seems like all anyone talks about.”

“Well, we didn't do anything in public, obviously. I got beaten up as it was. But at home we cuddled and slept next to each other at night, and kissed sometimes. Mostly I just liked being next to you.”

“Were we happy?”

“Yeah. We were.”

Bucky nodded, and then relaxed against Steve, breathing in the scent of him. He nuzzled up under Steve's chin and sighed in pleasure. He didn't say a word for the rest of the day.

Both Sam and Bucky's therapist suggested Bucky find a positive outlet for his energy. Bucky didn't like to do much. He absolutely refused to get up before noon for anything. He liked soft things, and curling up to read in the sun. He read anything he could get his hands on in English, French, German, or Russian. He read novels and speculative fiction and satire, research material and textbooks. He worked out to keep in shape, pushing himself brutally until Steve made him stop or he collapsed from exhaustion.

Bucky did not like eating, unless it involved chocolate. He hated therapy and doctor's visits, though he didn't mind visiting Tony's workshop and talking about his arm. He didn't like it when Steve had to leave on a mission and someone came to stay with him. If he had to have a babysitter, he preferred Darcy, letting her talk at him for hours.

None of those activities really helped Bucky burn off energy positively, and Steve was despairing that they'd find anything Bucky liked. Bucky wasn't allowed out of the tower, and didn't want to leave in any case. He was convinced the moment he left, Hydra would reclaim him, and nothing anyone said would persuade him otherwise.

Steve came home from a brutal three-day mission to find Darcy sitting on the couch, knitting yet another brightly colored sweater for Bucky. Darcy had an unhealthy obsession with knitting, and Bucky liked soft things and was cold a lot, and the result was that he had at least a dozen brightly colored sweaters, hats and scarves all knit in cheerful, soft yarn. He looked ridiculous when he was scowling at the world while wearing a sunshine yellow hat, rainbow scarf, and bright blue sweater, but he did it anyway.

Bucky was no where to be seen.

“Is Bucky asleep?”

“What? Oh, no, he went up to the roof.”

“And you didn't stop him?!” Steve dropped his bag and shield and sprinted back out into the elevator. He'd have run but it was nearly twenty floors, and JARVIS could get him there faster.

“Rooftop JARVIS – hurry!”

“Of course, Captain. May I state that Sargent Barnes isn't currently exhibiting suicidal behavior?”

“I need to see him.”

Bucky had only tried to kill himself once, with a kitchen knife. He'd slashed his vein from his wrist to his elbow in a precise gouge, and if Steve hadn't found him in time, he would have bled out. It had scared the hell out of him.

Steve wasn't sure what he'd been expecting on the roof, but it wasn't Bucky on his",candidate00004
"'d knock you up.”

“That almost never happens the first time.”

“Uh huh. That's what Christie Miller said, and she's huge now; baby's due in July. You're just lucky you didn't have a knot for her, or that kid'd be yours.”

“Steeeeeve. Please. Don't I smell good? I'm dying here, you gotta help me. You gotta tongue, don't you?”

Steve came, just like that. Just the thought of sticking his tongue into Bucky and licking out all his slick – Jesus Christ. “Jesus, Bucky, you can't say things like that.”


   “You just came, didn't you! I wanna come Steve. I'm so fucking hard. C'mon, it's even legal! Everyone's gonna think I fucked you all week long. Just. Just. 
  Dammit, Steve.”



   “Okay. 
  Okay.” The come in his trousers is cooling rapidly, and is kind of uncomfortable, but Steve's horny enough that he doesn't really care, because Bucky smells so damn good. It's not the first time he's wanted to fuck Bucky, just the first time the other man has wanted it back. And that in itself is such a startling revelation that Steve can barely keep his hands to himself.


“If yer ma comes back and catches us -”


   “She won't. And if she does well. I'm havin' my first 
  heat Steve. It'll be okay.”



   Steve doesn't quite know what to think about the fact that everyone seems to be not only on board with him fucking Bucky, but that it's also inevitable, as if Steve can't control himself. He could, if Bucky wanted him to. But Bucky 
  doesn't want him to so – He doesn't know what he should do here. If he does get Bucky pregnant, Steve's ma will be so disappointed in him. But if he doesn't, and it's just Steve helping Bucky through a heat well. Maybe that's okay. Bucky certainly seemed to think so, anyways. And Steve might never get another chance.


“Yeah. Yeah okay.”

Bucky smiles, and it's the most beautiful thing Steve's ever seen, even with his cheeks flushed and red and covered in sweat. “You're the best Steve.”

“Well...” Steve blushes. “It ain't like I'm getting nothin' out of it.”


   Bucky doesn't seem to want to talk any more, because he's pushing down his trousers and making frantic motions in Steve's direction. Steve helps him pull everything down all the way, and moans at the sight of Bucky all slicked up. He smells like himself and sweet slick and also overwhelmingly of Steve. He's hard again all at once. He didn't even 
  know he could get hard again like that but apparently Bucky smelling like he's Steve's is enough to do him in.



   He stops worrying about being polite and goes right between Bucky's legs, his tongue coming out to taste him. It's good – it's 
  really good, and Bucky writhes above him, making the most amazing sounds. He doesn't quite lose himself to his hormones after that, but he doesn't really seem to care any more if Bucky's mom comes home or what they're gonna do after Bucky's heat is over or what the hell all this means, if it means anything. There's just the taste of Bucky on his tongue, and his hand on Bucky's flushed and swollen dick, and the overwhelming need to make Bucky feel good.


By the time Bucky comes around Steve's tongue and his own stomach, Steve's come twice more. If he had a proper knot, he would have held it all in and then come all at once when his knot finally popped, but his knot doesn't work right, even with all the pheromones coming out of Bucky, so he kept coming every twenty minutes or so, instead. He'd always wondered about how coming for over five minutes felt, but it wasn't like he wasn't enjoying himself. If this was how sex was all the time, no wonder everyone wanted it.

They lay on the bed together after that, Steve still desperately aroused and Bucky just dosing between rounds of heat, sleepy and content except for the ache in his dick. He notices that there are now heat supplies on the end table beside Bucky's bed – a pitcher of water and packets of Kool-Aid for quick energy, some dried fruit and jerky, and most mortifying of all, alpha grade condoms. Apparently Bucky's mom had come in while they were – occupied.

“Bucky...”

“Mmm? You wanna go again Stevie?”

“Your ma bought us condoms.”


   “She what?” Bucky sits up quickly and stares,",candidate00004
".” Jackson looks over at Stiles across Derek's chest. “That would make you sort of in charge too, right? Like if anything happened to Derek, you'd...take care of things?” “Nothing is going to happen to Derek.” Stiles says fiercely, because he is not putting that out into the universe. Not, not, not. Jackson ducks back down again and looks like he wishes he hadn't said anything. Stiles immediately feels terrible, because even if the kid used to be a dick, he didn't deserve this whole mess. “Yes. Yes, we are. Are you all happy now? I've only known the guy for two months and we're irrevocably tied together, because my magic always messes shit up. So you're stuck with me.” Isaac's voice is a hoarse whisper, “You're not mad, are you? That you're...stuck with us.” “No! No. Shit.” This isn't going at all the way he'd planned. Call him old fashioned, but he'd wanted a little romance first before he became magically tied to another person. It's scary okay? Knowing that Derek's the one, he's it, no take backsies. He's fucking terrified. And if that isn't enough, he's somehow become pack mom to a bunch of scared kids when he can barely take care of himself. “Just. I know it probably makes you all feel better, to have a definite 'Alpha.' Better for your wolves. So I'm telling you, yeah, I'm Derek's mate. But we're leaving it there; it's only for the wolves, okay? As far as the humans are concerned Derek and I are dating and maybe engaged if he bothers to get me a ring, but we really just haven't. Haven't talked about it, and I don't – it's just a lot. So we're. Yeah.” He trails off lamely. “Yur t'ribble at expla'ng.” Derek slurs, and his grip gets tighter on Stiles' hand for a moment. “Oh yeah, sure. I'd like to see you do better.” Derek's eyes are tired, pupils blown because he's definitely back on the good drugs. “Ya see...wen Daddy an' Daddy luv each oth'r v'ry much...” He trails off into what is definitely a giggle. “Okay nope. You're done. You're on waaaaaaaaay too many drugs to be committing to anything right now.” “I do tho. Love you.” Derek whispers, his eyes sliding shut again. Everyone's eyes are wide. The pack looks at one another, and they slip up out of their seats together, heading out and leaving Stiles alone with Derek. They are so obviously not even going to get involved in that. Each of them scent marks him on their way out though, rubbing their hands against his hair or shirt, but they don't say a word, for which Stiles is grateful. Once they're gone Stiles groans and leans into Derek, pressing his forehead against Derek's chest. Derek's hand is slack in his; he's really gone back to sleep. Typical.  “You sir. You are the worst.” Stiles should be mad. He knows he should be mad, but instead he's just sort of shell shocked. He really hadn't seen that coming. So he just slumps into Derek and tries to think about what he's going to say when Derek wakes up.

Hey guys, I've been busy doing Camp NaNo, but it's been a while so I thought I'd post up a chapter.  Hope you guys like it!

Standard warnings for my fics; potty mouth Stiles, mentions of violence and torture.

    Derek hates therapy.  There are pretentious humans trying to tell him how to take care of his body, like he doesn't know.  He just needs to find somewhere safe, and rest, and he'll heal in a matter of hours. Except he isn't healing, he's got a cast on, a metal rod in his leg, and his right eye is dead and blank.  And now there is a frazzled man, who's lean enough that Derek could snap him in half if he wanted to, trying to teach him how to walk.  Like he can't figure that out.  These crutches are stupid, he hates them.  He's seriously contemplating gnawing his own leg off.

    Finally Stiles comes and rescues him.  He facilitates the conversation, explains that Derek's not going to be stuck in these forever, and helps him use them to walk around the room a few times.  Frazzled guy looks relieved; apparently Derek is a terrible patient.  They are supposed to do therapy for an hour, but it's been forty-five minutes",candidate00004
"finally jerked awake and pulled away. Heero didn't say anything else about it. He picked up his books and went back to his room, though he did come out when Duo got around to making dinner.

Several weeks later, Duo was at yet another gallery showing, and he stopped in front of a relatively small, unobtrusive canvas. It was a painting of a young man coming up out of water – what kind of water, Duo didn't know. The man was gasping for breath, but it almost looked like – no. No way. He wouldn't.

Duo glanced down at the price tag to see that Heero had had the audacity to price the damn thing at 500,000 dollars, and it had already been sold. Heero came up to him, looking way too damn pleased with himself.

“Heero.”

“Mm? You don't like my painting?”

“You painted your o-face and sold it for half a million dollars.” Duo hissed.

“I don't know what you're talking about.” Heero said, but he was smiling.

xxx

 

Duo didn't mean to eavesdrop on Heero's private conversation with Quatre. He came home just like he did every day, he wasn't even trying to be quiet. Only, when he came in, Heero was standing on the porch with the glass door open and Duo could hear every word.

“What am I supposed to say Quatre? 'Oh, hey Duo, I'm desperately in love with you, only, I'm not sure I really understand what love is. Please date me. Oh, and I hope you don't like sex all that much because I don't really want to ever have it.”

Heero was facing away from him – he clearly hadn't heard Duo come in, which meant he must have been very worked up.

“No it's not the same as you and Trowa. You two have been together for practically forever. Yes I noticed. I'm trained to notice, even if no one ever bothered to teach me how to have a relationship myself. Besides Trowa practically breathes sex and I -”

He was pacing now. He still hadn't noticed Duo was there and at this point Duo wasn't really sure what he should do. If he moved Heero would probably see him, but if he didn't move, he'd just keep overhearing what was most definitely supposed to be a private conversation.

“What am I going to do? Hire a hooker? I'm not going to try having sex with some random -”

Loud, rapid swearing in enough different languages that Duo couldn't follow interrupted the conversation.

“Never offer me Trowa like that ever again. I don't care if it was his idea, it was a terrible idea. Aren't you supposed to be good at reading emotions?”

Heero turned then, and saw him. His whole body went rigid, his face closed off. Shit.

“Look, I have to go. I'll see you – later. Some time. Yeah. Okay. Bye.”

“Heeeeeey Heero. Look, I um.”

“Save it. I'm going to Wufei's for a week.”

“What?”

Heero's eyes were cold. “I don't want to talk about what you just heard. I've been planning on going to visit Wufei for a while. Alone. Just.” Heero closed his eyes and grit his teeth, grinding the heel of his hand against his forehead. “Just. Maybe we'll talk about it later.”

And then he stalked off to his room, presumably to pack. Which meant that they wouldn't talk about it until at least Heero got back, which meant they probably wouldn't talk about it at all. Great. That could have gone better.

He didn't hear from Heero for the entire week. After about four days, he tried calling Wufei, but all the other man would say was, “If he doesn't want to talk to you, I'm not going to be a messenger pigeon. He's fine, he'll be home at the end of the week.”

So that was awesome.

Heero returned exactly when Wufei said he would, with an entirely new wardrobe, and a more angry than usual scowl on his face. Apparently he hadn't enjoyed his trip. He looked – haggard, like he hadn't slept at all the entire time he was gone, which Duo supposed was possible. He would have thought Heero would be comfortable sleeping at Wufei's, since they had fought together, but apparently not. Maybe Wufei's security system wasn't up to Heero's exacting standards.

Heero didn't speak until he'd put his things away in his room, come back out and made a cup of coffee, and then sat down with it at the table, nursing it slowly. When he did speak, he made no fucking sense at all",candidate00004
"working his way through a set of stretches, enjoying the slight soreness left over from the sex. It would have been better if Shinji had actually fucked him, but then again...he wasn't sure if he was quite ready for that yet, so perhaps this was best.

Even though he was taller, Shinjiro actually didn't like to top very much. He'd always been the more passive of the two of them; always going along with things when Akihiko wanted to fuck, but rarely instigating anything himself. He'd fuck Aki when he asked, but he was also more than happy to bottom, and never seemed to worry about any of the stigma attached to laying on his back and taking it. Not that Akihiko really thought any of that was true, but it still lingered sometimes in the back of his mind.

They'd never been public about their relationship. Neither of them had been open about the fact that they enjoyed spending time with other men. Some of Akihiko's girlfriends had been suspicious about it, but really Akihiko was less interested in them because of a lack of shared interest than that he preferred dick. He liked both genders, but the only other women who knew about Personas and the other life he led were like sisters to him. Shinjiro was the only one he'd really felt a connection with, in that way. Shinji put up with him, even when he knew he was being overbearing, or too aggressive, or obsessed with fighting. Sure, they argued, but Shinjiro was one of the only people who would go where Akihiko led, but also push back when Aki needed it most.

“I'm back,” Shinjiro announced, toeing off his shoes as he entered. He had at least six bags of groceries on each arm.

“You shouldn't be carrying all that,” Akihiko protested, getting up and taking some of the bags from him.

Shinjiro scowled. “You're not my physical therapist.”

“I'm not your neurologist either, but I bet you're not going to listen to either of them, so I'll have to do.”

Shinji just made an irritable hand motion. “Did you at least boil the eggs? No. No you didn't. What am I going to do with you?”

“Shit.” He'd completely forgotten.

“Whatever. Here, put this in a pot and boil it. You can cook the eggs at the same time.” Shinjiro dug around in a bag and handed him a fresh pork bone. “For flavor,” he said.

Akihiko did as he was told, because Shinji's food was always good, and he did at least have a pot big enough for a soup base. After he got the water and eggs boiling, he helped by chopping up vegetables while Shinjiro made noodles from scratch, because he was crazy like that. Then he stayed out of the way while Shinji made the soup; instead putting away all of the fresh food Shinji had gotten him. If he knew his friend, Shinji would have gotten the day old vegetables, so they were cheaper, but still good. Akihiko had a small salary draw from his time with SEES, and he also worked part-time teaching boxing while he figured out what he was going to do now that he'd graduated and everything was over.

“Do you have a place to stay?” Akihiko asked.

“Mmm. Yeah, I still have my apartment above Club Escapade. They held it for me while I was in the hospital.”

Akihiko knew that Shinjiro and the Club Escapade owner were close, but he hadn't known they were close enough for the guy to hold Shinji's apartment for him. Well. That was good. Aki had this half idea that he'd ask Shinjiro to come live with him but this was probably for the best.

“What else have you been doing?”

“Annoying my physical therapist, smoking too much. I started working bar at the club again, just part time for now. It pays for the apartment at least. And I get to eat there for free. I'm not sure what I actually want to do now that things are over.”

“Yeah, me either. I've been sort of thinking about going to college, but I don't know what I'd go for. I've got some offers at the boxing club to go pro; I'm thinking about it.”

“I think that'd be good for you. Physical activity is basically all you do anyway. Can you really see yourself as a salaryman?”

“Ugh.”

“Heh. S' what I thought.”

“So you really have no ideas?”


 “Eh, I think I might take the 
high school equivalence test. 

I never got to finish my education, and it's – I don't know, I just feel like I should, you know? Then, well, I'm good at cooking, so maybe I could do something with that, but I don't really want",candidate00004
"? I can't just leave him.”

“Why does it have to be you?” Isaac asks, clearly worried for him.

“Because, everyone else in the pack is either a werewolf or a hunter, or a banshee. I'm the only human, and I think he really needs that right now.”

“Stiles...”

Stiles steels himself, and then reaches out a hand to Derek's shoulder. Derek turns around with a snarl, but stops when Stiles shouts, “Stop that!”

Derek actually whines, and presses his nose to Stiles' hand. Stiles grimaces and tries to ignore the blood that smears across it. The important thing is that Derek is focusing on Stiles now, and his snarls have tapered off to a low warning growl. Scott and Isaac are staring at him with a mix of horror and wonder.

“See?”

“Stiles -” Scott tries to walk towards him, and Derek snarls again. He backs up helplessly, his features melting back to human as he tries to look non-threatening.

“Stiles, we can't just leave you here.”

“Yes you can. It's Spring Break, and I already failed my last test, so it's not like there's anything else I was planning on doing over break anyways. I just need you to tell my dad I'm out doing werewolf training or something. And ask Deaton what I'm supposed to do about Derek. Other than talking to him and trying to comfort him, I really have no ideas.”

Scott looks at Derek, who's crouched at Stiles' feet like a dog, still nuzzling his palm. It was obvious that he had no idea how to handle Derek like this, so it was a damn good thing that Stiles had already stepped up to the task. “I...yeah. Yeah, I'll go ask him. Meet you back here when we figure out what to do?”

“Yeah, I don't think I'm going anywhere. Might try to get Derek to wash off somewhere though.”

Isaac's sniffing now, and points off towards the direction Derek came from. “There's running water that way.”

“Thanks.”

“Good luck Stiles. Try not to get eaten.”

Stiles made a face. “We'll be fine. As long as you brought me food.”

“Yeah, it's in the bag. See you in a bit.”

Scott and Isaac take off, and Stiles looks down at Derek with a sigh. “Might as well eat breakfast, huh Derek?”

Derek makes a sort of woofing noise at him, and takes off towards his deer. This was going to be harder than Stiles thought.

xxx

It takes some doing, but he manages to start a fire, convince Derek that he really doesn't want any of the deer Derek had brought back, and sit down and eat his breakfast. Derek keeps whining at him while he eats, but Stiles really doesn't feel like watching Derek eat a deer raw, so he looks out at the forest while he munched on pop tarts, trying not to listen too hard to the sounds Derek makes.

Once Derek has been quiet for a while, and all his pop tarts are gone, Stiles turns around cautiously. Derek is sitting beside a pile of bones, which have been completely picked over, and is now licking the blood off his hands. He is actually a good deal cleaner than Stiles was expecting, except for the gore under his nails that Stiles doesn't want to think about.

“How was your breakfast, Derek?” Stiles is determined to talk to him like he is still a person. He is really hoping that will help bring Derek out of it. That, and companionship, since one of the biggest reasons weres lose themselves is because of loneliness.

Derek looks up at him, his eyes piercing, and still red. They have yet to fade back to his human color, even when his features are mostly human. Stiles wonders if that is a bad sign.

xxx

Trying to get Derek to bathe is an experience, to say the least. Sometimes it seemes like Derek knows what he's saying when Stiles talks to him, but other times he just seems to like the sound of Stiles' voice. Which is a nice change, but so not helpful here.

He'd managed to get to the stream that Isaac had mentioned to him, and to get Derek to go stand in it. He isn't going in, it's freezing. Derek seems to like it though, even if all he does is stand there in the water with a stupid smile on his face. He really likes spending time with Stiles, apparently.

“No, Derek, you have to get under the water. Otherwise you're just getting your shorts wet.”

Derek cocks his head to the side, like he almost understands what Stiles was trying to say. Stiles mimes what he hopes is a passable motion for ducking under water and washing off. “Under the water. Personal hygiene Derek, it'",candidate00004
"walked to his father. ""When you see something happening, what are you supposed to do?""

""Come and get you right away,"" he droned, the straw flopping in his mouth. Elros pulled the offensive bit away, tossing it behind him. ""I wasn't the one doing something wrong,"" Vardamir half- sneered, staring at the bit of straw that was in the grass as a butterfly with blue and gold wings chose to land upon it.

""Vardamir, you're older than they are,"" sighed Elros. ""You're also twice as big, you can't keep telling them not to do things and threatening that you're going to hit them. It is my job to discipline them, and to keep you in line as well.""

""So I should just let them keep doing it?""

""No! You should come and get me!"" Elros shook his head. ""If you get me, then I will tell them not to do it.""

""But if it's wrong,"" countered Vardamir, ""then what does it matter if I tell them it's wrong or if you tell them it's wrong?""

""Because I don't want you telling them you're going to hit them!""

""But I don't hit them! You're the one who hits them!""

""No, I spank them, when they need it. I'm their father,"" replied Elros through clenched teeth. ""I'm your father, too, and you're this close to being taken over my knee.""

Vardamir opened his mouth to continue, but Manwendil shrugged Elrond's hands from his shoulders and ran to Vardamir. ""No, daddy, no, he was only worried about me,"" he said, flinging his arms around Vardamir's legs. ""He didn't do anything wrong, please, daddy, I won't cry about the butterflies anymore, I promise."" On the verge of tears, Manwendil kept his word, making a snerking, sniffling noise as he kept himself from crying.

Elros closed his eyes and rubbed the left side of his face, making a circular motion at his temple. ""Elrond, I have children for sale, going cheap,"" he mumbled to his brother. ""In fact, if you take these two, I'll throw in the two in the cabin free.""

""No thank you,"" replied Elrond quickly. ""I have none now, and prefer it that way.""

Elros grinned. ""Someday, brother,"" he said, and turned his attention back to his angsty eldest and anguished second-youngest. ""I'm not going to spank Vardamir. I may tan the hides of your brother and sister,"" he said, looking back in the direction of the log cabin that overlooked the lake, a small hideaway the twins had built for themselves and their families and close friends to use in a quiet, hidden valley.

""That's fine, they deserve it,"" Manwendil answered. ""I would even help.""

Even Vardamir couldn't help but smile as Manwendil crushed his face against the legs of his older brother and mumbled that he wouldn't like it, but he would do it if necessary as his father and uncle laughed. ""Come on, little man, let us go and see if they have heeded my orders or not."" Elros hoisted Manwendil up onto his shoulders and began to walk to the cabin. Elrond and Vardamir followed, with the favorite uncle bumping into his nephew enough times to finally crack a smile, and then a chortle, and finally Vardamir allowed Elrond to sling his arm around the boy's shoulder as they trekked up the slope.

""You know what is worse than a spanking?"" asked Manwendil from his high vantage point.

""Not a clue,"" answered his father. ""What's worse than a spanking?""

""To clean out the horse stalls,"" he answered. ""Because it stinks and it's squishy between your toes if you step wrong in the hay.""

""I suppose it has nothing to do with it being your chore, does it, clever little man?"" asked Elros, glancing up. Manwendil shook his head. ""Alright, then, a week of stall cleaning for them, and you can come fishing with Vardamir and Uncle Elrond and I tomorrow while they do it."" Manwendil nodded his head twice very prominently.

""Maybe they should both have to milk the cow this week, too,"" suggested Vardamir hopefully.

""Don't push it,"" warned Elros. ""Be thankful you're not cutting a switch for me right now.""

Vardamir shoved his hands into his pockets. ""Yes, sir.""

""Here, take your brother and get cleaned up. Don't say a word to your brother and sister, either of you,"" added Elros as he lifted Manwendil down to the ground. His sons nodded and raced to the water pump. ""When are you going to get yourself married? I want to see your elflings before I die,"" said Elros when the children were all in the cabin.

"his legs nearer to his body. “’Night. Sleep now.” 

“Rumil...” Haldir stifled his own yawn. “I do not envy you. It has been a long night,” admitted the eldest brother, waving his hand to the forest floor in the direction of where orcs had tried to break through the defenses to the city. “But the night guards need this post. Come along, Rumil, the other tree is not so bad.” 

“Tree cold. Sleep here.” 

Haldir stepped up next to Rumil, looking down at his brother. “Orophin, grab his legs,” he instructed, bending down to grab his little brother’s arms. Rumil twisted around, springing for the trunk of the mallorn. His arms just barely made it around, and he hooked what few fingers could reach each other together. 

Orophin stood off to the side, watching with amusement as Haldir tried to pry Rumil’s fingers from the bark. Rumil swung his legs around and wrapped them around the trunk as well. Haldir let go in exasperation, landing on the hard wooden floor. “Rumil, I am no longer amused. We are leaving. Get up.” 

Rumil did not budge, but Orophin strolled over to his brothers, helping Haldir to his feet. “I think we should leave the two of them alone,” suggested Orophin. “He seems very attached to the tree.” 

“He is practically bonded to it,” growled Haldir, brushing off his uniform. 

Orophin nodded. “Soon, he shall be calling it Nenniach and will stay overnight to keep it warm.” 

Rumil lifted one eyelid slightly, peering out at Orophin. “You told me you would not tell anyone about that.” 

“Correction, little brother,” said Orophin. “I said I would not tell Nana and Ada about that.” 

Rumil pouted and loosened his hold on the tree. He looked up at the limbs that swayed above and pushed himself away from the trunk. 

Orophin chuckled. “Poor Rumil, I hate to make you move,” he said, offering his brother a hand. “I can see how attached you are to sweet Nenniach here,” he teased, patting the tree with his free hand. 

“It is just a silly tree, Orophin. I am not that attached to it,” Rumil said as he took Orophin’s hand and was pulled up, fully waking up now. Haldir rolled his eyes and headed for the hole in the floor that served as their door and kicked down the rope ladder. The tree did indeed hold special meaning for Rumil, for he and Nenniach would sneak away to this outpost when it was not in use. The guard shifted to various posts from time to time so that there was no pattern to the trees they used. Now, Rumil’s hiding place was back in the rotation, and carelessly forgotten wine bottles and blankets had alerted his brothers earlier in the week that the outpost had not exactly been left unattended. 

“When we get to the other tree, I shall let you sleep,” promised Orophin, leading Rumil to the exit, “and shall sacrifice myself and eat your supper so that you can rest.” 

“You shall do no such thing,” scolded Rumil, crouching down to the ground to climb out. 

“Oh? And why not?” 

“Because...” answered Rumil, “I shall get there first and eat your meal instead!” The two brothers fought their way down the ladder, and Haldir thought to scold them for being so noisy, but thought better of it. The captain would be one of the guards replacing them, it was best he reprimand Orophin and Rumil, thought Haldir. Best to hear them shouting at the edge of the border without Haldir’s voice thrown in. 

Instead the young elf moved to the trunk of the tree and wrapped one arm around it. The other he pressed lightly on the bark and closed his eyes, whispering softly to it. The sounds he made were less like speech and more like hums, but his message was clear to the tree. “They do not know what they say. You are special, not silly. Tall, and proud, and kind to let us build in your branches and use them for protection.” 

A sound came from the tree, something of a creaking and twisting noise. Haldir smiled and drew both arms around the trunk briefly before making his way down the ladder. 

Below, he found that his brothers had been caught by the Galadhrim Captain, but instead of being lectured to, the pair, along with those who had come to replace them, were all staring up at the tree. Haldir landed lightly upon the ground and strolled up to his captain, bowing with respect. The captain acknowledged the warden, but returned at once to looking at the tree. 

“No activity to speak of, not since last night,” reported Haldir, and the captain nodded, still looking at the outpost. “Shall we take our leave?” 

The captain nodded once more, but waved a hand at Orophin and Rumil as they tried to leave. “No, not the two of you. I shall have a word with you about your behavior",candidate00005
"a little, and handed it back. “Mmm, you put honey in your tea like Nana,” he complimented as he hopped down. “Let’s go,” said Elrohir after pushing the scarf back in place. 

“Why me? Wait, who is us?” Erestor had already agreed in part, for he was now standing up and being pulled along by his sash. Handing his teacup and plate to the nearest of the servers, he reached down and dislodged his sash from Elrohir’s hand. 

“’Lorfinnel an me.” 

“Lorfin... oh, Glorfindel.” Erestor sighed at the snickering and laughing around him at his expense. For a moment, Erestor hesitated and looked out the window again. Then, he smiled almost wickedly. “Do you mean to tell me that you left Glorfindel out there by himself to fend off both Lindir and your father?” 

“Uh-huh.” Elrohir nodded his head, and then kept waddling towards the door, reminding Erestor of the strange birds that lived just south of the Helcaraxe in Valinor. 

“Well, then, we should go and see how he is doing.” Erestor’s delight was fueled more by getting to see Glorfindel being pummeled with snowballs by Elrond and Lindir than it was for truly wanting to help in this wintry battle. 

A gust of wind blew through the house as the door was opened, and Erestor shut it tight once he was on the grand front stoop of the house. He and Elrohir stood at the top of the steps observing the battle. Glorfindel was actually doing fairly well for one against three, having managed to erect a small snow wall around himself, but he had to crouch down for it to do him any good as a barrier. Slowly, it was being knocked away by the onslaught of the others. 

“Oh noh!” complained Elrohir, huddling against Erestor as another cold wind tickled his exposed nose. “Once the fort is gone, they win!” 

For a few moments, Erestor smirked as he watched Glorfindel draw his arm back and get hit with a sloppy pile of snow that ran down his face and slid down his already soaked and snow-caked clothes. A second one hit his chest, and the snowball dropped out of his hand. Bending down, Glorfindel scooped up another mound of snow as a chunk of the fort was knocked away by a low pitch by Elladan. Looking to the other team, Erestor frowned when he saw the state they were in. Obviously, Elrond and Lindir had been well-prepared to do battle in the snow, while Glorfindel was only in his regular clothing and had no mittens or gloves, no scarf or hat. 

Feeling a pang of sympathy for the warrior, Erestor shuffled down a few steps where a drift had formed and packed a snowball firmly as he watched the fight. “Elrohir?” Erestor waited for the elfling to join him. “You make the snowballs, I’ll throw them.” 

With a grin that Erestor could not see, Elrohir began this task, making snowballs as big as his little hands could make them. The first one hit Elrond squarely in the back of his neck. Lindir and Elrond turned, only to find themselves assaulted in two directions. 

Standing at the top of the stairs, Erestor had a definite advantage. The tide quickly turned, and the trio that had been winning now spent more time trying to block the quickly thrown balls of snow. “We won! We won!” shrieked Elrohir, screaming happily as he tottered down the steps. He greeted his brother with a returned hug and the two looked up at their father. 

“It appears that with our captain’s reinforcements,” spoke Elrond, loud enough so that Erestor (who was still holding a snowball, just in case of retaliation) could hear, “have appeared just in time. Lindir, we have lost.” 

“You have to pull us on the sleds now!” Elrohir reminded the two defeated elves. Lindir nodded and after Elrond gave each of his sons a pat on the head, hoisted up Elrohir onto his shoulders. 

“Last one to the shed is a...” Elrond looked up at Elrohir. “What should they be, ion?” 

“A... a slimy leach!” he shouted gleefully. 

“A slimy leach? Not I!” declared the minstrel, and he lifted Elladan onto his own shoulders, following off after Elrond. 

Back on the battlefield, Glorfindel had been moving closer and closer to where Erestor was still standing on the steps. One arm was behind the slayer’s back, concealing a snowball he had gathered along the way. “Erestor, my hero!” he shouted, and when the dark elf looked at him cautiously, he even went so far as to bat his long, blond, snowflake-covered lashes. Erestor narrowed his eyes in return. “For such bravery... you should be handsomely rewarded.” 

The snowball left Glorfindel’s hand the exact moment that Erestor threw the last one of his in return. Glorfindel was hit on the shoulder, while Erestor’s knee fell victim as well. Both ellyn chuckled, and Glorfindel continued to move closer. “Well, now... it’",candidate00005
". I shall send your mother.” The youngest had a brief look of fright in his eyes, but Haldir and Orophin continued to remain indifferent as Celeborn made to leave. 

Lord Celeborn turned back around, his attention suddenly caught. On the ground behind Haldir and Orophin was a large pile of leaves. Huge leaves from the mellyrn. At this time of year the trees should not have even shown the slightest sign of shedding their cover. The leaves, he noted as he looked again, were healthy and green. Celeborn stepped forward slightly, eyeing the mound. 

“Pay no attention to the large pile of leaves,” Orophin said quickly. “They are of no concern.” He was quickly kicked in the shin by Haldir, who growled inaudibly at Orophin’s outburst. 

Celeborn narrowed his eyes, looking to each of the brothers in turn. His look fell at last upon the pile of leaves. It was large, yes, but surely not large enough to conceal the prince. Besides, they were likely using it as a diversion. Celeborn pointed a finger at the trio, and was about to give them a good scolding when the pile of leaves sneezed. Celeborn’s attention flew back to the heap of green, noting that a few of the leaves were now resettling. 

“Bless you, my lord,” said Rumil, speaking for the first time. He pulled a square of fabric from his pocket in one fluid motion, lifting it up to his father. “Handkerchief?” 

Celeborn raised a brow, looking thoroughly unamused. “I shall go to the Great Mallorn and I shall count to one hundred, and when I have finished, I shall be bidding the delegation from Greenwood – the ENTIRE delegation - a safe and pleasant journey to Imladris, or, I shall be personally seeing to it that three members of this realm are also on their way to Imladris, after which, they will travel to Mirkwood Forest, where I am told assistance is needed in taking a census of all of the spiders living there.” Celeborn turned on his heel, his robes swirling and then trailing behind as he walked away. “One...two...three...four...” 

As soon as Celeborn was out of earshot, all three brothers set to the task of pulling Legolas out of the pile of leaves. “I think I am allergic to something in the air here,” admitted Legolas, rubbing his reddening nose in a very unprincely manner. 

“I apologize for the inability of my brothers to keep a secret,” said Haldir, glaring at his siblings as he helped remove leaves and grass from the prince’s hair. The prince responded with another sneeze. 

Rumil looked hurt. “I did not do anything! I tried to cover up the sneezing.” Rumil crossed his arms and pouted. 

“Eh, Rumil, he does not mean it. He is not upset at you, he is upset that Nana is going to find out.” Orophin slung his arm around Rumil’s shoulder, but it was quickly pushed away. 

“Do not Rumil anything me,” grumbled the youngest. “You blew it. Ada would not have known if you had not directed his attention to the pile of leaves.” 

“Oh, he knew before then,” countered Orophin, but Haldir interrupted with, “I am NOT upset that Nana is going to find out.” 

“Yes, you are. She is the only elf you are afraid of,” Orophin shot back. 

Haldir’s fists clenched, but before any further words could be exchanged, Legolas threw an arm around each of the elves. “Come now, I do not wish to see my brothers fighting.” 

Rumil repeated Legolas’ action across from him, so that the four now stood, linked together in a circle, heads bowed slightly to the center. “Are we really like your brothers that you call us that?” asked Rumil hopefully. The young one bordered on his majority, constantly unsure of whether he was elf or elfling, and his reaction seemed to favor the latter. 

Legolas smiled warmly and nodded. Orophin and Haldir readjusted their own arms to complete the circle, and Haldir even reached far enough to give one of Orophin’s hands a squeeze of concession. “I have always wanted a younger brother, and if you permit me, I shall have three.” 

Rumil was grinning madly now, but he waited for permission on this from his older brothers. Orophin laughed. “Surely, you can not be as old as Haldir or I.” 

Legolas looked at the eldest brother. “How old are you again?” 

Haldir cleared his throat and thought for a moment. “One hundred and eighty one.” 

“You are just a baby then!” laughed Legolas, leaning his head against Haldir’s. “Although, not much younger than I, I suppose.” 

“And how old are you?” Orophin asked. 

Through the trees came Celeborn’s voice, still counting, though he shouted now, and was more than impatient. “Sixty-seven...sixty-eight...sixty-nine...” 

“I must make haste,” Legolas said. “You shall have to guess, for it will be a",candidate00005
"yawned a little loudly.  “Did you write back?”

“Not yet.”  Fingon sat up and drained his glass dry so that he could discard it for now on the floor.  Before he settled down again, he removed a clasp from his hair, which caused a mass of hair to cascade down.  He gathered it up and used the long, loose locks as extra cushion for his head against the arm of the sofa.  “I was not sure what you wanted me to say.”

Beleg yawned again, but was determined not to drift off to sleep.  Not with a warm mug of cider and a question that had been burning in his mind suddenly open for debate.  “What were you thinking of telling her?”

Fingon folded his hands and looked at the ceiling.  “What would you say?”

“Well…”  Beleg abandoned his drink on the side table and reached for Fingon’s feet with his nearest hand.  As he massaged tired toes, he said, “I would begin with, Dear Lady Anairë, You do not know me but I am the man who is living with your son.”

“The man who is living with me.”  Fingon blew a puff of air from between his lips.  “Accurate,” he commended.

“I suppose you should confirm my title, though,” prodded Beleg.  “Just to make it easier on your mother.”

Fingon began to play with the cording of his shirt, and in time they loosened so that it was slightly open.  “I fear we could keep each other at this all night.”

“Doubtful.  I am going to fall asleep right on this couch, within the hour.”

The terrier dragged his toy back to his two-legged companions (he often felt sorry that they lacked half their legs, because it meant they could not romp like he did) and flopped beside the sofa for a nap.  “Out of morbid curiosity, what did you call Túrin?”

Beleg snorted.  “Túrin,” he answered flatly.

“Ah.”

“What did you call Maedhros?” asked Beleg.

“Maitimo, Russandol.  Also lover, dear, and darling, until it became asshole, fucker, and son-of-a-bitch.”

Beleg rubbed his beard.  “I think those last two might be a little harsh, but if you go for calling me asshole, maybe you should explain to your mother it is a private endearment before you tell her the word.”

Fingon pulled himself up a bit, and Beleg let go of his feet.  “I would never call you that.”

“Good.  In fact, I think I hate them all, especially Russandol.”

“That makes two of us,” replied Fingon.  He rubbed his eyes.  “Man I am living with is the winning option thus far.”

“Perhaps we can start a new trend with it.”  Beleg closed his eyes.  “You want me to stop skirting the issue and be honest?”

“Please.  I mean…”  Fingon made the same little puff of air noise as he had earlier.  “I am lost for the word.  Titles have meanings that cling to them.  I am unable to describe what we are with a single word.”

Another yawn escaped Beleg.  “Why are we here?” he asked.

“Sorry, what?”

“Let me rephrase that.  Why did we decide to take up the offer to come live here while the other three sort things out?  Why solitude?  Why this lonely cottage, with only us and a few animals for company?”

“Because you kissed me in Tirion.”  Fingon blushed, yet pretended not to notice.

“Is that all?” 

“Why are you here, with me, then?” asked Fingon.  “What is your answer to your riddle?”

“Because I kissed you in Tirion,” repeated Beleg. 

Fingon snorted.

“Because I love you.”

Fingon swallowed hard.

Beleg waited and then said, “You are not required to say it back.  I know you were hoping for something more with Glorfindel and Erestor.  I have very little hope to see Túrin again, but I still hold onto that hope.  I think for you, with the return of Faelion, whatever hope you had is gone now, and you do not want me to think you are settling for me.  I think we both know we are settling for each other; that said, I know that I would still love you if someone else came along for either or both of us.”

Immediately, Fingon stood up and walked the length of the room to a bookcase that was chest high.  He folded his arms on the top, back to the rest of the rom, and said nothing.

Beleg left Fingon alone for a time.  He cleaned up the glasses from their beverages and let the terrier jump on his lap for a few minutes.  When the dog excused himself, Beleg approached Fingon.  “If I made you uncomfortable, I am sorry.”

“I was just not expecting that.”  Fingon was solemn, his voice soft.  “I have heard those words from so few people in my life.”

“Surely, your parents have said it before, at the very least.”

"one without some duty to be done. When one wished a place devoid completely of documents to sign and meetings to attend, there was only one place to be found.

“I hereby crown thee King of Eregion!” Nimfannel, one of the two ladies-in-waiting who had joined the small party on this secret vacation, set a crown of holly upon Erestor’s head. It tilted down over one eye, and he lazily adjusted it while some of the others applauded his new rank and others, such as Elladan and Elrohir, simply laughed.

“I am uncertain of whether this is a good thing or not,” admitted Erestor to Glorfindel as Nimfannel pranced away to look at something that Lindir had found. 

Glorfindel plucked a berry from the wreath and popped it into his mouth. “I have a feeling it will be a very short-lived reign, if Elrond expects us to return by late summer.” They were lounging in the tall, soft grasses, robes of state and damasked armor left at home. The party had traveled very light, forgoing even tents in the hopes that they would not be caught up in too many rain storms. 

Oronel, the third and final lady of the party and chief scribe to Lord Celeborn, had spread the blanket from her horse on the ground to be used as a picnic cloth and was setting out the first lunch which did not consist of lembas and water since they had disembarked. “I do love the architecture, or rather, what is left of it.”

“Imagine how it was when it stood proud upon the horizon,” reminisced Erestor. “Here, where we are now, was once a glorious stairway of stone and marble, with columns that seemed to touch the sky. At the top of the stairs was a wide platform, and from it King Celebrimbor ruled his people and created his greatest works in the open-air forge that was found upon either side of his throne.” Erestor’s voice became quieter as he continued. “This, too, was the place where Annatar came to suggest an alliance, where I stood beside Celebrimbor as Oropher’s messenger as he called the leaders of the three peoples of the Elves, and where eventually Annatar’s true self was revealed and he brutally murdered Feanor’s grandson. The stairs, when they yet remained, were stained with the blood that was spilled. They are overgrown now, as you can see.”

“As is everything else,” remarked Oronel. The columns had been tipped a millennium ago, and here and there rubble could be found to make a case as to where one had fallen. The steps were no more than a tilt to the landscape, and the holly had overtaken the platform, save for a pile of stones that resembled a crushed stone chair. “Is that his throne?”

“Indeed, it once was. The trees and plants here are not the same from those days, for the land was laid to waste and all was burned,” explained Erestor. “But the stones remember him, and his people, and what was here once.”

“How can stone recall residents long gone?” wondered Elrohir. The others had joined the picnickers once food was made ready, and to listen to the stories Erestor had to tell, for not even Glorfindel had arrived by the time Eregion had fallen. 

“How can a jewel burn the hands of the unworthy? How can a ring call to its master?” Erestor sat up and removed the crown from his head. “Arda lives and breathes, just the same as you or I.”

As they ate, they spoke little, most contemplating the land and the rich history lost. Yet even with such loss, beauty was regained. The lush leaves of holly blanketed the land, and red berries gleamed upon the bushes, inviting birds and Elves to taste the fruit forbidden to others. Very few other animals roamed the area, not due to the presence of the Elves, but for the lingering evil that would send a chill up even a squirrel’s spine. It was a shame, for the grass was sweet and tender, and the trees held plentiful fruit, despite it being only early spring.

Only one member of the party was lost in thought, recalling the bustle of life here in great detail. It was once the hub of Elven culture in Middle-earth; anyone who was anyone lived in Eregion. The finest wines, the best tailors, the most perfect jewels, the newest music, and the richest foods were all to be found in this land of holly. All lost, all gone, all forgotten – save for some Elves whose luck managed them the moniker of ‘old’ and the crumbled stones of buildings which were once graceful and majestic.

“Why has no one rebuilt this place?” asked Lindir near the end of the meal. All eyes were upon Erestor in hopes of some sage answer.

He smile as he looked about and watched a thrush land nearby to yank at the softened berries from the previous year that still clung to some of the bushes. “Elves never rebuild anything. Have you none of you realized that our tribes are nomadic",candidate00005
"walked to his father. ""When you see something happening, what are you supposed to do?""

""Come and get you right away,"" he droned, the straw flopping in his mouth. Elros pulled the offensive bit away, tossing it behind him. ""I wasn't the one doing something wrong,"" Vardamir half- sneered, staring at the bit of straw that was in the grass as a butterfly with blue and gold wings chose to land upon it.

""Vardamir, you're older than they are,"" sighed Elros. ""You're also twice as big, you can't keep telling them not to do things and threatening that you're going to hit them. It is my job to discipline them, and to keep you in line as well.""

""So I should just let them keep doing it?""

""No! You should come and get me!"" Elros shook his head. ""If you get me, then I will tell them not to do it.""

""But if it's wrong,"" countered Vardamir, ""then what does it matter if I tell them it's wrong or if you tell them it's wrong?""

""Because I don't want you telling them you're going to hit them!""

""But I don't hit them! You're the one who hits them!""

""No, I spank them, when they need it. I'm their father,"" replied Elros through clenched teeth. ""I'm your father, too, and you're this close to being taken over my knee.""

Vardamir opened his mouth to continue, but Manwendil shrugged Elrond's hands from his shoulders and ran to Vardamir. ""No, daddy, no, he was only worried about me,"" he said, flinging his arms around Vardamir's legs. ""He didn't do anything wrong, please, daddy, I won't cry about the butterflies anymore, I promise."" On the verge of tears, Manwendil kept his word, making a snerking, sniffling noise as he kept himself from crying.

Elros closed his eyes and rubbed the left side of his face, making a circular motion at his temple. ""Elrond, I have children for sale, going cheap,"" he mumbled to his brother. ""In fact, if you take these two, I'll throw in the two in the cabin free.""

""No thank you,"" replied Elrond quickly. ""I have none now, and prefer it that way.""

Elros grinned. ""Someday, brother,"" he said, and turned his attention back to his angsty eldest and anguished second-youngest. ""I'm not going to spank Vardamir. I may tan the hides of your brother and sister,"" he said, looking back in the direction of the log cabin that overlooked the lake, a small hideaway the twins had built for themselves and their families and close friends to use in a quiet, hidden valley.

""That's fine, they deserve it,"" Manwendil answered. ""I would even help.""

Even Vardamir couldn't help but smile as Manwendil crushed his face against the legs of his older brother and mumbled that he wouldn't like it, but he would do it if necessary as his father and uncle laughed. ""Come on, little man, let us go and see if they have heeded my orders or not."" Elros hoisted Manwendil up onto his shoulders and began to walk to the cabin. Elrond and Vardamir followed, with the favorite uncle bumping into his nephew enough times to finally crack a smile, and then a chortle, and finally Vardamir allowed Elrond to sling his arm around the boy's shoulder as they trekked up the slope.

""You know what is worse than a spanking?"" asked Manwendil from his high vantage point.

""Not a clue,"" answered his father. ""What's worse than a spanking?""

""To clean out the horse stalls,"" he answered. ""Because it stinks and it's squishy between your toes if you step wrong in the hay.""

""I suppose it has nothing to do with it being your chore, does it, clever little man?"" asked Elros, glancing up. Manwendil shook his head. ""Alright, then, a week of stall cleaning for them, and you can come fishing with Vardamir and Uncle Elrond and I tomorrow while they do it."" Manwendil nodded his head twice very prominently.

""Maybe they should both have to milk the cow this week, too,"" suggested Vardamir hopefully.

""Don't push it,"" warned Elros. ""Be thankful you're not cutting a switch for me right now.""

Vardamir shoved his hands into his pockets. ""Yes, sir.""

""Here, take your brother and get cleaned up. Don't say a word to your brother and sister, either of you,"" added Elros as he lifted Manwendil down to the ground. His sons nodded and raced to the water pump. ""When are you going to get yourself married? I want to see your elflings before I die,"" said Elros when the children were all in the cabin.

Runechild raised an eyebrow. ""Why would you fight the Empire? Aren't you a Nazi?""

My jaw might have hit the floor. ""What?""

""Yeah."" Runechild sounded confused. ""You hang out with Nazis, and you're planning to help Allfather take over the Empire. I just figured. I mean, you're nicer to me than Allfather, so you're probably not a very good Nazi, but still.""

""I'm not a Nazi."" I said firmly. ""The thing with the Empire is just because of my contract with Allfather. If you'd contracted to take over the ABB, I'd probably help you with that in the same way.""

She shivered. ""Let's stay away from them.""

I didn't press the issue. We both lapsed into thoughtful silence.

It seemed like my ruse to masquerade as an Empire cape had been successful enough to convince an impressionable twelve-year old girl. That whole thing was… did I even need it? Was associating with the Empire to protect Dad worth the effort?

My contract with Michael had opened a lot of new doors for me. Enough that I felt confident in being able to walk away from the Empire before things got serious. Allfather was definitely the deal-breaker though. If Allfather wasn't going to be in charge, I had some serious misgivings. I didn't know who Krieg was or what he was like. I couldn't count on him to honor the same things that Allfather would, and I didn't trust him in the same way.

It was sounding more and more promising to just strike out on my own and gather ghosts solo. I'd always wanted to be a hero, but more than that now, I wanted to live. It eclipsed any other goals I had. Now that I had a chance to come back, I was going to claw my way back to life. Getting entangled with the Empire would just impair that.

The warehouse door swung open and Allfather strode in. He was wearing civilian clothes again. Speak of the devil…

""Say hi to the fuhrer for me, fraulein."" Runechild said with a smirk. She skipped off down the catwalk. I let my solidity go, phasing through the catwalk to the floor below.

""Hey."" I said. Seeing Allfather was awkward. I knew he didn't want to see me, but now that I saw him, I realized that I missed talking to him.

""Taylor. Are you ready for the rally tomorrow?"" He said. ""You've got that costume, but have you gone over the speech we prepared?""

""Yeah. I practiced a bunch earlier. Noriko helped me.""

""I see. The entire city is going to watch. If you don't feel comfortable, I can speak instead.""

What he was saying should have been comforting; offering to take a burden off me. But the way he said it was so cold and formal that it just made me uneasy.

""I can do it. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.""

""See that you don't."" Allfather said. He was already turning to leave.

I dithered there, trying to think of something to say, something to mend the distance that had formed between us. My failings had driven Dad and me apart, and now it was happening again.

""I'm looking forward to completing our contract!"" I shouted.

Okay, so maybe I was pretty pissed off at him too. He'd ditched me in a warehouse for a week because he was too upset to deal with me.

Allfather froze, one hand reaching for the door.

""What did you say?""

""You heard me.""

He turned on his heel and in an instant, towered over me; his stare as cold and hard as ice.

""Taylor, think carefully about what you're going to-""

""I'm not joining the Empire either."" I met his eye without flinching. Allfather opened his mouth and I cut him off again. Time to go all in.

""Why have you been avoiding me?""

""I haven't been.""

""Don't lie to me Allfather. I thought we were on better terms than that.""

A red flush was rising in his face. Was it embarrassment, or just simple anger?

""Taylor, I wouldn't lie- I just…"" Allfather dropped his gaze. ""I",candidate00006
"let her bomber jacket fall to the floor, exposing her under-tank, drawn tight over a body like an olympic athlete. 


The sprawling heart and rose tattoos on her biceps were as vivid as ever.

Her sister’s smile hitched a tad. “It’s Magdalene, now. Remember?”

Bethany was tapping her pockets again. Where was her lighter? Where was it?! “So I’m ‘Bethie,’ but you don’t get to be Big Sis Mags?”


 “
Ma’am, are you ready to check out?” the clerk interrupted. 



 Bethany jerked- she’d forgotten he was there. “Get out of here, you stupid fuck!” He stared, all blank doe-eyes at her. Bethany snarled at him and let hellfire bloom in her palm. “This is a robbery, now 
run you fucking moron
!”


The kid gaped, then turned to run. He was scrambling for the door into the employee’s quarters when Bethany turned away.

Maggie was watching her, thumbs hooked into the straps of her top like suspenders. “I’m going to have to kill him,” she said. “No witnesses, remember?”

“He won’t remember. Muggles can’t comprehend shit.” She was back to patting herself down, trying to find her lighter. She needed to self-immolate, to burn herself with something. Magical flame didn’t have the same effect- she couldn’t power herself by burning herself with the thing she was powering.

And… she didn’t have it. She’d left it in the car. Wait- the car. She wasn’t here alone. Maggie was standing between her and the door, but that didn’t mean much.

Bethany pointed and fired. A tiny fireball rocketed from her fingertip and shot through the glass of the front door. It hit the tarmac outside and burst, scattering sparks everywhere. She was hoping it’d start a fire out there, something mundane to fuel herself with, but it was no dice. It sputtered out, even as the last of the glass was falling.

“Looking for someone?” Maggie said calmly.

Another figure stepped into view in the doorframe. Red hair, cut short enough to expose the pale scalp beneath it. Gangly and incongruous in his button-down shirt and slacks, looking more like a budget Jehovah’s Witness than anything.

Lazarus.

“How’s it going?” he drawled, the twang in his voice more pronounced than in Maggie’s. “Just runnin errands, Bethany?”


 He stepped through the doors, coming more clearly into her sight. Blood poured from his eyes and followed in his wake like a slug-trail. 
A 
gash
 across his neck was 
spurting
 onto his shirt, slowly dyeing it red, even as the wound closed.


“Did you get her?” Maggie asked.

“Eve got away. Wounded her, but then she ran for it when I regenerated.” He fingered his neck for a moment, probing the cut. It closed a bit more as Bethany watched.


Maggie shrugged. “We’ll just get her afterward.” She tilted her head to one side, then the other, cracking her neck. 



 “Anyone ever tell you two-on-one is bullshit?” Bethany said. She could hear muffled pounding from inside the office. The kid hadn’t gotten out, which meant there was no exit there. There should be a fire door in back, 
but she hadn’t seen one yet. Maybe by the bathrooms?


The bathrooms that were almost certainly down a dead-end hallway if there was no fire door.


Slowly, Bethany reached out and snagged the brown paper bag the clerk had been using to store her groceries. The carton of cigarettes he’d pulled was beside it. She grabbed that too, tearing it open one-handed. 



 Her siblings were beginning to fan out. Maggie was stalking toward her, taking her time. Lazarus was hovering in the background, poised to cut off any escape routes with his shots. 
Two-on-one was bullshit though. Solo, she’d be able to take either one of them, but together they could cover their weaknesses.



 “So,” Maggie was saying. “Lilith really needs to be more careful. She’s 
very
 distinctive with all those brats of hers.”


Bethany paused with a cigarette halfway to her lips, her blood running cold. They knew where the apartment was. Lilith was vulnerable. They’d waited until they’d split up and moved in.

She pressed a second cig in beside the first. Lit both.

She grinned around them, letting her fire grow for the first time in days. “You stay the fuck away from my sister.” The tips of her twintails ignited, her hair rippling in the heat wave, her eyes suddenly full of hellfire.

The bag burst into flame in her hand, the carton burning a moment later. Their ignition was magical, but their incineration was purely mundane. Beth’s grin grew wider as the fire burnt through the flesh of her palm,",candidate00006
"When we're done, bleeding Hugo Masters out over the floor drain like wild game, she's still flushed, lips parted just a little.

Slowly, she reaches out. I let her, curious to see what mechanisms drive this new quantity.

Her nails are seafoam green, chipped from working the hammer. She presses her fingertips to my lips. A caress- no a brush, as she draws back, her fingers red. Some of the blood splatter wiped away.

Madison raises fingers to mouth and paints her lips red, seafoam nails dripping and crimson.

A shuddering, breathy little noise from her, eyes half-shut, teeth worrying bloody lip. The tremor that shakes her petite frame is… familiar. The trembling joy- the sheer rush- the power trip. These things, I know.

For the first time since meeting her, I feel at ease.

XXX

We walk home together. It's been a while since I last had a sleepover. Madison is quiet most of the way; the silence is comfortable.

It's only as we're entering the final stretch that she pastes herself to my side, arm knitting into mine. A soft, contented sigh.

She's not quite Emma, but there's nothing wrong with that. The differences, the tuneless humming that she starts up as we walk, the slight boniness of her shoulder in my ribs. These things are present, and I accept them.

There is something different in the hunger inside me as I watch Madison's giddy, almost loopy smile. She is not Emma, nor Sophia, but she is broken all the same.

And the hunger in her is all the connection we need.

XXX

Sophia is the first and last. I've shared my darkness with her the longest, but she is bound, a collared tiger under the Protectorate.

Our first kill together was special. By far the most planning for one execution. A bit clumsy in retrospect, some kinks that'd be worked out in the future. She doesn't take part, waiting outside while I work. But she listens, and it couldn't have happened without her aid.

I know she's killed before. But I also know that none of those were deliberate. Missteps. Clumsier by far than my first kill. Errors in judgment- a crossbow wound that bled out. A man dangled and then dropped on accident. Others, never concealed for too long.

She was young and dumb, and I'd like to think I have better judgment, but Jamie Masters proves me wrong. Sophia at least has the advantage of being a cape. A get-out-of-jail card in the Protectorate.

In the weeks after, I continue my predations. She assists as she can, a name here, a tip there, but under watch there is only so much she can do. Emma and Madison are with me, participating a little more each time.

I begin to worry. Not the usual paranoia or suspicion. Concern that Sophia, who facilitated my first, our first, has begun to drift away.

And so I call her.

XXX

Sophia picks the target.

We meet, clandestine, lugging him into a building I scouted the week before. She phases through the door, unlocks it, and we're in.

It's only as I begin tying him to the chair that she glances around.

""Where's the other two?""

I look over my shoulder and give her a carefully practiced 'friend' smile. ""It's just us tonight.""

I even light some candles to set the mood.

XXX

His name is Kevin Reiners- though he won't divulge that until I work on his face with the same little propane torch I used to light the candles. Judging by the elaborate tattoos on his body, he's spent quite a bit of time with E88. I take my time melting them away, and when that grows tiring, try my hand at the cheese grater.

I don't know what he's done to earn her ire, but Sophia stays, silent, dark, watchful, a presence at the back of the room.

Round One ends with him screaming himself hoarse. I step back to take a breather and work the stiffness out of my hands.

Our eyes meet.

Her eyebrow rises.

I look pointedly at Kevin Reiners.

She stares between us for a long moment. And then she walks out of the room.

I find myself sighing, a little disappointed, and I'm having trouble working up much excitement for Round Two.

The door opens again.

Sophia pads in. She has a jug of the bleach I use for cleanup.

Oh hoh. The flare of hunger, of curious wonder is enough that I set down my knife entirely.

I move aside.

This is her show now. Her first real, true kill.

I expect her to dump it down his throat. Not in the eyes or his wounds or any of that. My gut says she's too pragmatic to waste time when there could",candidate00006
"checking for threats, for anyone who might do something, and then returned to staring at the floor.

A man sat down in the seat across the aisle from her. Taylor turned away so he couldn't see what a mess she was. Hopefully, and she almost laughed bitterly at the thought, he'd think she was just another homeless person.

The bus started up again, turning down a side street as it headed for the next stop. There would be four more before hers.

""Excuse me.""

The landscape outside blurred into a mélange of shapes and colors; all dirty buildings and concrete.

""Miss?""

Taylor blinked. She looked up.

The man in the other seat was eyeing her. He held out a hand, and she drew back reflexively.

""It's alright,"" he said. He opened his hand, showing her a folded white handkerchief. ""See?""

She stared, making no move to take it. Annoyance flared up inside her. Why couldn't he just leave her alone and mind his own business? She looked at him again. What was this about? People didn't just do stuff like this in Brockton Bay.

The man's age was indeterminate, older than thirty, maybe forty, from the fine lines at the corners of his dark eyes, but it was hard to say. He had a… vitality about him, something in the way he sat, and the calm, knowing smile on his face, that she hated at once. It was an ugly, basic feeling- jealousy that he was happier than her.

The man didn't lower his hand though. ""I don't bite,"" he said, a note of laughter in his voice.

""What do you want?""

His smile widened just a bit. The man brushed a strand of his long, black hair back with his free hand, tucking it back into the loose ponytail he wore. ""You looked like you needed to dry off.""

""Don't worry about it."" She knew she sounded rude, and didn't care. It wasn't his problem.

""Alright then."" He pocketed the handkerchief, but didn't turn away. Taylor's annoyance grew into anger, her fists balling in her lap. Go away. 

""How did that happen?""

""None of your business.""

""Of course not."" He shrugged lazily. ""Doesn't mean I can't be curious.""

She returned to looking out the window and didn't answer.

""I'm a bit of a people person,"" the man continued, his voice still calm and undaunted by her rejection. ""And right now… I'd say you're having a bad time.""


No shit.


""Teenage girl, alone on her own in the middle of a school day, all covered in… what is that- soda? Having trouble at school, darling?""

Taylor whipped around, all her frustration from the day boiling over, pushed past the breaking point by this man who just-wouldn't-go.

""Fuck off!"" she hissed at him.

A few nearby passengers glanced back at her, and she lowered her voice even further, snarling her words at the man.

""Just leave me alone. What do you care, huh?!""

He only blinked slowly. ""Like I said, kiddo, I'm just a curious observer. I saw someone in-"" He paused. ""Someone who needed someone else to talk to.""

She curled her lip at him, uncaring of what he thought- he was a stranger. ""Leave me alone.""

""What does it cost you?""

That stopped her. She squinted at him through her smudged glasses. The man had an angular face, his chin lightly-stubbled; he looked vaguely familiar. She didn't know him from somewhere, did she? Was that why he was being so odd?

""What does what cost me?""

""To talk to me,"" he explained.

The bus came to a stop, and their conversation paused while passengers came on and off.

""Why would I want to talk to you?""

""Why not?""

She turned to fully face him for the first time. Her anger had ebbed, replaced with something more like incredulity at the man's sheer persistence.

""I'm a stranger,"" he said. ""I don't want anything from you, and I thought you might like a friendly ear to ah- vent to."" The man held up his hands as if to say 'why not?' ""Besides, I'm only in town for a week or two, tops, for business.""

Taylor didn't answer him. The red flags were still up; this whole thing felt eerie, but the man was just so earnest… and insistent. Was he maybe- was this a gang thing? Did gangs recruit like this? She bit her lip. What if it was some kind of weird sex thing? An older man trying to pick up a teenage girl.

She dismissed that thought as quickly as it came.",candidate00006
"The Dust needed to be dissolved, and then it needed to be attuned. Putting unattuned Dust into the body was like throwing gunpowder into a fire. The Dust was out of sync with the user’s aura, and they would war, vibrating against each other until the Dust inevitably ignited.

There were chemicals that could aid this step. Solvents could liquefy the Dust, and then be separated with the centrifuge. But that would be slow, and the centrifuge was just as loud as the grinder.

She focused on the vial, on the smooth glass pressing into her palms. It was easier to think about that, to center on it, than on herself. It was a goal, and possibly… a solution.

Her aura surrounded her at all times, a second skin. It took a conscious effort to move it, an atrophied limb stirring into motion, and-

She hissed as her aura pulsed down her arms. The first minute felt like sunburn on the inside of her skin; tender flesh and muscle crying out as her aura seared them. The tube flared with a flickering, misty light as she suffused it, holding on even as her limbs ached.

Aura met Dust. The blood began to churn as she enfolded the grains, not activating, but grinding them even more. She’d described it to her father as being like ‘stones in the ocean.’ Larger pieces were worn down and broken apart with constant motion. Her aura moved in steady, rhythmic waves grinding the grains of Dust together, using their own friction to wear them down.

It was a calming, soothing metaphor that didn’t really take in how much it hurt.

The second minute was worse. Her hands began seizing around the tube, muscles writhing under the skin as the pain escalated to a white-hot burn. The flow stuttered, thinning, and Wynn gritted her teeth.

“Not yet. Not yet.”

Her aura was dwindling, slowly and inevitably. Her body was shutting off the external aspect of her aura in the same automatic way it might shiver in the cold. It was the hard limit that prevented her from spending a lethal amount of lifeforce.

“Just-a-little-more.”

Each compression was like working handfuls of molten sand now, her aura screaming as she forced it to move. Necessity kept her going. This had to happen.

Slowly, the Dust began to dissolve, melting into the blood like sugar in water. She closed her fists around the vial and pushed. The psychic “channels” that her aura flowed through were pinholes now, and she whined with pain as she forced them past their capacity. The Dust was thrumming in her hands, a song just out of tune with her own.

It was reacting in a way she’d never seen before. Her aura was moving in ways outside her direction, caught in a flow she hadn’t made. Fighting it felt wrong, like walking against a river. Wynn let her aura move as it needed to, and found her eyes going wide as the Dust grains began to burst. They weren’t igniting- this was like seeds germinating; she was completing something in the Dust, and they were dissolving, merging seamlessly into her blood.

This had never happened before. Previous samples usually ended up gritty, full of grains that refused to dissolve. It was a-

“Miss Schnee?”

She jerked with surprise, nearly falling off her stool.

“Miss Schnee, are you in there?” Someone called from outside. Dimly, she thought it might be one of the maids. The knob turned, then caught. “It’s time to get ready, Miss.”

“I’m busy,” Wynn snapped, trying to keep her voice level around the furious heat in her hands. “Come back later.”

There were faint, scuffling footsteps as the woman fretted outside the door, and then-

“Your father was very insistent that you get ready.”

It was definitely one of the maids. Probably Sapphire.

“Go away!”

She paid for her distraction with a surge in her aura. A purple bruise bloomed on the back of her hand as the blood vessels ruptured under the aural pressure.

Wynn yelped, but kept going. The door was specially reinforced to protect her gear. The maid would need a key to get through.

“Are you okay?” Sapphire called, sounding worried. “Did you fall?”

Wynn ignored her.

The last grain melted away, and she let her aura go. The flow rebounded on her like a wild dog, and she had just enough time to drop the vial back into the rack before the spasm hit her. Her hands twitched and curled, her eyes rolling back, back arching, teeth bared in a rictus. She tipped backwards, and only one flailing, kicking leg under the table kept her from toppling over entirely.

From outside came the sound of heels on stone as Sapphire scurried away.

The seizure lasted an eternal minute, Wynn’s body drawn to the breaking point before finally collapsing against the table like a rag doll. It was dumb luck that she didn’t pitch face",candidate00006
"sit down and listen. ‘Ceus, you’re freaking out for nothing.”

Lillie held out a hand for her phone back, but Selene didn’t offer it. They looked at each other for a long moment, Selene blinking drunkenly, Lillie glaring, her heart in her throat.

“Two minutes. And then I’m taking you to a doctor.”

“Anyone ever tell you you’re cute when you’re- urp.” Selene’s words cut off in a gulp. She covered her mouth, eyes wide. Lillie skittered away, but thankfully, Selene shook her head and relaxed.

“False alarm.” Her thumbs-up was the least convincing Lillie had ever seen.

“One minute,” Lillie grumbled. “This isn’t a game, Selene.”

“I know. It’s science.” Selene reached out and rubbed the Clefairy. “Thanks to Clementine here, and my other friends-” She waved at the Pokemon around her.

Lillie gave them her full attention for the first time.

Cinder, Selene’s Salazzle was curled up, tail flicking idly as she watched the conversation. To her left was a slimy, tentacled Pokemon that Lillie didn’t recall the name of. Some kind of aquatic predator with- judging by the thick spines covering its blue flesh, poisonous barbs. Under the table, a vividly colored Ariados was working thread between its chelicerae, weaving long ropes that it looped over its back spines for later use.

There were others, some of Selene’s regular team, but those three and the Clefairy were the closest at the moment.

Lillie squinted. Selene wouldn’t possibly…

“Are you poisoned?!”

Selene touched thumb and index together. “Bingo.”

Lillie lunged for her phone. She toppled into Selene and they both knocked into the kitchen table, scattering Pokemon left and right. She’d been expecting Selene to struggle, but the other girl let her have the phone, and after a moment to right herself from where she’d pressed Selene down, Lillie retreated.

She started dialing again. Not a doctor this time, but the nearest hospital. It would be in Malie City, and that wasn’t close enough. The flight wouldn’t be nearly quick enough. They’d have to ride together, so she could make sure Selene didn’t fall off. And-

“How did this happen?”

Selene jerked a thumb over her shoulder at the rows of science equipment. “I’m trying to build up an immunity so I can train Poison types better.”

Lillie stopped dialing to stare at her.

“Don’t give me that look,” Selene said. “It’s perfectly safe. I take a sample from one of the Pokemon, dilute it with Antidote and a couple other chemicals, and then inject it. I give myself an hour to start feeling it, and then I have Clemmy use Aromatherapy to cure it. Rinse and repeat. I did Ariados last night. That’s why he’s just sitting around.”

Lillie stared some more. The inner workings of her mind ground to a halt. She understood. She didn’t understand.

“You’re… trying to build up… an immunity,” she said slowly.

“Yup. I’ve got Poison Affinity from my Dad’s side, apparently, and I always wanted to specialize in them. Just never got the chance, you know?”

Selene grinned. One eyelid was more open than the other, and she was swaying on her feet.

“And you thought it would be a good idea to do this alone, in the middle of nowhere, with no medical staff on hand, without telling anyone?”

“Well… when you say it like,” Selene said, her grin thinning slightly. “Sounds kinda crazy.”

The last piece of the puzzle fell into place.

“Selene, when was the last time you took your medication?”

“This morning.”

“You mean when you got up?”

“Nope. That’s when I normally take it. But I haven’t slept in a couple days, so I just decided to take it at 9am every morning.”

Lillie frowned. That didn’t make sense. Selene wasn’t behaving rationally. She was normally energetic and creative, and prone to stupid ideas, but… this was downright bizarre and self-destructive. It wasn’t like her at all. This was how she behaved when she missed a dose.

She glanced around the kitchen, taking in the mess of equipment. Where had Selene even gotten this stuff? Team Skull hadn’t been cooking meth or something, had they? Her eyes flicked across Clementine, now dabbling her paws in the sink.


Clemmy uses Aromatherapy to cure it.


“Selene, does Aromatherapy discriminate between chemicals?”

Her girlfriend cocked her head, looking confused.

“How is it supposed to know the difference between the chemicals in poison that hurt you, and the ones in your medication that keep you stable?”

She could tell the moment when it sank it.

Selene blinked slowly. And then her smile faded.",candidate00006
"properly. I roll this along your arm, and you tell where where the feeling stops. Or if it feels wrong.”

Genji’s arms had not originally been cybernetic. Not both of them. There had been more of the left remaining than the right. But there had been issues with weight and balance early on in testing, and she’d finally just amputated and replaced the entirety of both with machinery to settle it. Easier that way.


 His right was 
made of the same grayish material as the rest of his underlayer. Beneath the carapace of his armor was a reinforced layer of fibrous nano-mesh. It did not feel quite like skin to the touch- more like silk, but it was thin enough that she’d been able to work in a full suite of nerve sensors. Touch, pressure, temperature, friction. A ninja’s hands were his livelihood. 
As a surgeon, t
hat, she could appreciate.


Angela began rolling the ball along his fingers. “You were asking about biotech.”

Genji nodded, his gaze following the ball once more.

“I am a surgeon. My work mixes biotic and nanite technology to regenerate form. But it does not create. It could, given time and research.”

He raised an eyebrow at that. “You have both.” He jerked a head at the technological paradise that was the Overwatch medbay.

“I do. Any issues with the feeling? No? Temperature is good?” Genji jerked as she took the ball away and pressed her fingers to his palm. Trimmed nails and cool fingers ghosted along surface of his hand, tracing where the life line would be on a human palm.

Angela smirked up at him. “The anecdote about doctors and cold hands holds true, I am afraid.”

He was stiff, his posture rigid, but he didn’t pull away. Angela gauged his reaction, not stopping her exploration of his palm. She didn’t have to guess to know this was the first human contact he’d had with anyone in quite some time. Shimada was supposedly quite the ladies man in his past life, and the look in his eyes as she held his hand was almost hungry.

“Something wrong?” she said.

“N-no.” He looked away. “Continue talking.”

“I have money, resources, and support,” Angela said. She ended her contact with him, not missing the way his hand followed hers for just an instant as she pulled away. “But I also have limits. These things come with strings.”

She returned to the ball, beginning at his wrist. The seam of flesh to metal, and his weapons attachments, she left alone, save to palpate them to make sure they were settled properly. There was no real sense in probing them with the ball- he had no sensation there. Just the vague pressure identified by the sensors in his skin, like something pressing on a fingernail.

Genji shifted as she nudged the piece of his arm where the armor plating would sit.

“Pain?”

“No.” His gaze dropped. “It feels strange. Like it is a part of me, but not. But… none of this is a part of me.”

“It feels out of place.”

“Yes.”

She rolled the ball across the area she’d repaired. “Good?”

“Fine.”

“Working for Overwatch comes with rules,” she said softly. “We answer to Jack, and he answers to the UN. And if the UN decided at some point after the Omnic Crisis, that one disaster averted was enough, and banned any advanced biotech research, we would have to follow those standards.”

“What?!” Genji jerked forward, nearly rising off the table entirely. “Why?”

“Cloning.” Angela set the ball on the table, pausing in her examination to meet his eyes. “If we created omnics and they turned on us, what would happen if cloning and biotech were allowed to advance to create new life?”

“That’s- that’s insane,” he hissed.

“It is cowardice.” Angela pressed her fingers to the nanofiber of his inner arm. Silken skin passed beneath her fingers. “And that is why we are stuck using prosthetics and cybernetics.”

Genji swore. She did not know the word, it was in his native tongue, but he said it in the tone used for epithets. “Insane. I’m stuck in this thing because they’re afraid. So worried about something that they’ve damned me to this shell.”

“Genji,” Angela said. “Genji, look at me.” She rose. Her hands moved from forearm to elbow to shoulder to chin. His was stubbled, just enough of his skin left for a beard shadow before the underlayer replaced his neck. Angela brushed her fingers through it.

His skin was warm. He stared at her.

“You are you. No matter how much of you is machine, the components that matter are here.”

A single finger pressed to his forehead.

“Please know that I have given you nothing I would not have myself.”

Genji frowned at that",candidate00006
"John sighs, leaning his back against the wall, close to the corner of the room so as to avoid as much attention as is humanly possible, while still being able to keep an eye on Sherlock so he’ll know just when he gets sick of mouthing niceties and starts telling truths.

It’s one of those dreary, horrifically monotonous dinner parties that Sherlock, and by extension, John, always gets invited to; by which John means that Sherlock is invited and, in an attempt to outrage as many conservative rich bigots as possible, drags John along as his date, touching him more than often and violating his personal space in ways that would have discomfited him six months ago (and John isn’t sure what to think of them now, but-)

“How’s the party, John?” Sherlock whispers in his ear, soft and caressing.

Without looking, John turns slightly and punches Sherlock in the stomach; not hard, but enough to elicit a wince of pain and a muttered gasp of “that was really quite unnecessary.”

“So was sneaking up on me for the millionth time, you moron,” John replies flatly, settling back against the relative comfort of his wall.  “What do you want?”

No response, which isn’t really surprising.

What is surprising is that, when John glances across, Sherlock isn’t there anymore; normally when he comes to bother John at functions like this, he’s more persistent than this.

“I’m not going to go look for him,” John tells himself.

He lasts all of about five minutes.

“Fondue.”

“Yes John, oddly enough I noticed,” Sherlock says sharply – or at least, he tries to say sharply, around the chocolate-dipped strawberry shoved with little grace into his mouth.

“Fondue.”

Sherlock glares at him as he chews.

He shakes his head, but the confusion doesn’t seem to be clearing up.  “I’m sorry, you – you wanted to tell me about fondue?”

It comes out a little more incredulous than he’d intended; and sure enough, Sherlock pushes off the wall to straighten to his full height, raising his chin in a far-too familiar look of offended disdain. 

Somehow, John finds himself looking up – not to meet Sherlock’s eyes, but at juice-stained lips. 

“If you-“

John, who’d had to sit through a good hour of Mycroft not-so-subtly threatening him with…something…if he let Sherlock make a scene, already knows where this is going and decides to cut him off as soon as possible.

“No no no,” he says hastily, raising his hands in what is probably far too defensive a gesture.  “I like fondue.  Fondue is good.  I haven’t seen fondue in years.” To emphasise his point he reaches for a strawberry, trying not to turn away from Sherlock as he dips it in chocolate and brings it to his mouth.

John had meant the motion to be a distraction; to pull Sherlock away from whatever ground of righteous annoyance he felt he was entitled to.

But it has been a while since John has had strawberries, and an even longer while since he’s had chocolate (not the crappy one pound chocolate from the store down the street but real, amazing chocolate) and without intending to he finds his eyes fluttering closed as he savours the meld of sweetness and rich, tangy juice in his mouth.

At some point he comes back down to Earth with a jolt of realisation; his eyes snap open and his lips part, because he can feel Sherlock’s gaze on him, dark and strangely intense, the usual grey swirled through with flecks of violet.

“I.  Um.”  He has to say something.  “I thought you weren’t into the whole eating thing.  For fun,” he adds because in all fairness, Sherlock eats.  Sometimes not at all, sometimes all day (and night) but it does happen.  Actually, if someone were bother to average out Sherlock’s eating habits over the past year, John actually thinks it might look like something vaguely resembling normal.

Sherlock doesn’t reply, just stares at him.  Self-consciously, John bites his lip and tastes chocolate (probably what Sherlock’s staring at, the judgemental bastard.)  Without really thinking about what he’s doing, John lets his tongue dart out to lick at the remnants.

When it’s gone, John refocusses on Sherlock – whose eyes flicker away from his mouth just a little too late.  Something flickers in his stomach, unsettling but strangely pleasant, and he can’t help but smile as a slight flush rises in his roommate’s pale cheeks.

“…Sherlock?  Sherlock, are- where are you going?”

“Home.  I’m bored,” Sherlock says loudly, not even bothering to turn around to look at John as people send reproachful glances in his direction.  “Are you coming or not?”

John laughs quietly as he follows.",candidate00007
"You come reluctantly to meet her, because do not fear war but the ocean is strange to you, and Westeros as far as the stars.  An army for a woman.

A fool would accept and so, Khal Drogo or not, you must be a fool.

Perhaps it is her innocence that draws you to her; she is young but not too young, older than some of the women in your khalasar who have already begun to service men.  If she were born Dothraki, she would be no different.

But if she were born Dothraki, she would not look as she does, pale and soft with long hair that shines like the centre of the sun, white and blinding.  You cannot help but look at her, touch her hair; she is foreign, fragile.

You feel her tears against the calluses on your hands and you fuck her harder.

 

~~~~~

 

Every time you enter her, you can’t believe it could feel any better; her body writhing as it is impaled by yours, her smooth white skin a complete opposite to your darkness, your war-torn hands and chest.

The first time she comes to you willingly, faces you as she pushes down on your cock and does not cry, you prove yourself wrong.

No – she proves you wrong, your tiny fragile delicate with iron in her bones and fire in her veins.

 

~~~~~

 

You know that she is the dragon her brother (that disgusting, scheming rat whose neck you would break in an instant if you did not know she still loves him) can never be, when she coughs, almost gags, and yet forces the rest of the heart into her tiny mouth.

Blood drips from her mouth, down her body.  Her lips are stained – and not just her lips, but the pale skin of her face.  Her eyes are wild, like those of an animal, burning fierce and crazed, and she could not speak a word now if she needed to –

She is beautiful.

And you promise her everything; her Iron Throne, her Seven Kingdoms, for she cannot deserve any less.  You promise and you know that you will not stop till you hand the world to her and your son.

 

~~~~~

 

It’s not a serious wound.

You cannot understand why she is concerned, why she calls the witch-woman to help you.

You are a warrior.

You are Khal Drogo.

And you are dying, the woman whispers to you.


No.


The Dark Stallion takes you quietly, its rider a not-man with an empty skull and soft, sonorous words that hum with kindness and rest (you are so weary, so tired, and your body means nothing because you cannot feel it and you are too busy watching her tears and hearing her screams to care-)

 

~~~~~

 

And just as your spirit is about to surrender, as all do, to the Great Stallion, a sense of wrongness sweeps you by and pulls you, as if by a metal rope, back-

But nothing connects, you are in your human flesh and you love her but this is too much.

End it, you order the witch-woman whore who killed your son (for you felt his spirit leave instead, quiet and confused and so young) for you to return like this.

She does not seem to hear the words you try to force from your unresponsive mouth, but smiles as though she hears you somewhere else, in the depths of her mind.

“And now you understand, Khal Drogo,” the witch whispers in your ear.

End it, you shout to Ser Jorah, the knight of Westeros.  End it and keep her safe (but do not touch her no man can touch her she is mine).

He frowns slightly, but then shrugs his shoulders in dismissal and you know  that no one can hear you.

But you try once more, because you must.

My love, you whisper as she weeps.  End it.

For half a day you think that she cannot hear you, that she does not understand.

But then you feel her mouth around your cock, you feel her try and you would give anything to show her but you can’t.

She is still crying as she pushes the pillow into your face and you love her more than ever.",candidate00007
"slightly, the sound pleasant and warm if a little strained.  Dean relaxes, glad that she’s not offended. She’s taken all of this incredibly well – only nodded and asked the barest of questions as Dean had talked, Sam jumping in occasionally with extra info, gaze intent and determined.  Since Sam left, they’ve been deviating slightly from the conversation topic – understandably, since with no new information apart from the confirmation that Mara/Leimara was lonely and missing home, there hasn’t been much to discuss – and Dean’s been discovering with no small amount of pleasure that Kate isn’t just easy on the eyes, she’s also intelligent and funny.

(And only about two and a half years younger than him, which is even better.)

Not that the first doesn’t tend to make up his mind most of the time, but the other two are brilliant, will take any girl from mildly attractive to extremely hot.

He’s suddenly aware that they’re sitting next to each other on the couch now, closer than is normally socially acceptable.  It’s not bothering him too much, and doesn’t seem to be bothering her.

“So-“ he begins, with some vague intention of suggesting – what exactly, he doesn’t know – and then his phone rings and they jerk apart, almost guiltily.  Kate pushes herself to her feet, muttering something about grabbing some biscuits, and Dean reaches into his pocket.

It’s Sam, of course, the always-dependable cock-blocker.

“What?” he asks brusquely into the phone in lieu of actually saying hello.

“I know what they are,” Sam says breathlessly, and then hangs up.

Dean stares at his phone, blinks slowly.  “Wow.  What a bitch.”  He shakes his head wonderingly then looks over to Kate.  “It was Sammy- Sam,” he corrects hastily, because as much as he’ll call Sam Sammy when they’re alone, it feels strange using that name in public.  Like revealing a secret about someone, except that the secret’s one of yours too.  “He says he knows what it is.  Didn’t say anything else, but at least one of us knows.   Good old Sam.”  He can’t help but smile fondly, because it’s true.

There’s a heavy sigh from the kitchen, and Dean looks up.  “I knew it,” Kate groans.  “the good ones are always taken or gay.  Or both.”   She shakes her head.  “I just don’t know why you guys felt like you needed to pretend to be brothers – I’m an actress, after all, it’d be pretty depressing if I was homophobic.”

It takes Dean a while to work that out.

“What- what, wait no, no, no,” he repeats, aghast.  “Sam’s my brother, we’re not, I mean, that’s…”

He trails off, suddenly uncomfortably aware that he’s not sure what that is.  He knows what should be leaping to mind, what he should be exclaiming (disgusting, wrong, perverted, incest) and for Sammy they’d be true.

Not for him.

(But he promised after Stanford happened never to think about it, never again.)

Dean glances at Kate again and realises with a start that she’s been watching him closely, frown of concentrating indicating that (much to his dismay) she’s been taking everything in.

“I believe you,” she says finally.  “But…you shouldn’t be so hard on yourself.”

“What do you mean?” Dean asks flatly.

With a roll of her eyes, she shifts her weight to rest her hand on her hip.  “I mean seriously, Dean, it’s pretty obvious that you’re really into him.  In a really not-platonic way.  And that he feels exactly the same.  You guys are meant to be.”

“No, I don- I’m sorry, what?”

“And I know the whole taboo thing sucks but you hunt supernatural things and have a criminal record, right?  You shouldn’t worry so much about it,” Kate continues over him like he didn’t say anything, stepping back towards the couch to pat his shoulder comfortingly before moving towards the kitchen again.

“I-“

The front door bursts open and Sam rushes in.  “I think we have a problem,” he huffs breathlessly, collapsing to his knees and barely managing to kick the door closed before something bangs on it, loud and insistent.

 

~

 

“Caiinell,” Sam explains around a mouthful of water.  The banging hasn’t stopped, though they’ve shoved everything in front of the door in an effort to provide as much protection as possible.  “They’re offspring of Cain-“

“Wait,” Dean interrupts, “as in Cain and Abel Cain?”

A beady glare from Sam doesn’t make Dean feel anything other than amusement, but Kate’s reproachful glance causes him to flush.",candidate00007
"and a half.  Your-“

“Oh, for heaven’s sakes, can someone tell me whatever I’ve been missing?” he finally snaps, sick of all the bickering when he’s spent – really, two years? – being panicked and terrified and, perhaps worst of all, confused.

They all freeze at his outburst, and when they move it’s to fidget awkwardly, with more than a little embarrassment.  Finally Ara sighs.  “Basically, the apocalypse.”

“…Sorry, what?”

“The last two years.  An apocalypse.  Zombie style.  That’s what’s been happening,” Lia says.

He nods slowly, piecing together everything he’s seen, every town he’s passed by and all the things that he’s been running from; the dead bodies he’s left behind, all of it.  “Okay,” he says, and then passes out.

 

~

 

In his defence, malnutrition is a perfectly valid reason to faint mid-conversation.

He’s more than aware of the fact that his ex-girlfriend and other female friend are going to hold this against him till the end of time.  They’re surprisingly light on the teasing, however, as they watch him shovel fruit and soup (apparently he’s not allowed to have any real food till his body’s used to metabolising that) as fast as he can.

“So what happened to you three?” he asks around mouthfuls of food.  “After you left Germany?” It comes out a little less coherent than that, and Ara’s nose wrinkles slightly in disgust, but she doesn’t say anything, glancing at Lia.

“Well, we pretty much did our whole travel thing, and we were here when we saw the news about Australia.  Just haven’t left, I suppose.”

“That was August 2016,” Raine adds.  “And then January last year, Lia picked up-“ She stops abruptly as Lia makes wild hand gestures – more than enough to pique his curiosity, but not strong enough against the seemingly endlessly ravenous hunger that’s still wracking his body.  “Um.  Yeah.  Anyway, a couple of months later in April, we managed to get back into the satellite networks, figured out who’s still alive-“

“Raine!” someone calls from the doorway in a heavily accented voice (European, North European, though that’s as good as his accent detection is right now).  “Call from London!”

“Coming!” she yells back, already pushing back her chair.  “Have fun with the whole apocalypse explanation thing,” she adds as an almost-afterthought to him, running out of the room.

“London?” he asks.

Ara shrugs.  “Meh,” is all she says.

Lia is more forthcoming – “Raine has a boyfriend,” she croons.  Ara raises an eyebrow at her, and for some reason she shuts right up with a subdued, “yeah.”

“So,” Ara continues, turning back to him and taking his now-empty plate – he didn’t notice – from the top of his blanket.  He wants more, but before he can even ask she shakes her head.  “Can’t eat too much,” she says, not unkindly.  “It’ll be the biggest waste when you throw it all back up again.”

Probably true.  Still, logic doesn’t stop his stomach from crying out for nourishment.

“Anyway,” Ara says.  “We’ve got Alice - from our NSG group – down in Antarctica.  They’ve got a full base of operations and practically untouched satellite control because it was way too cold for the zombie virus to even survive at all, let alone infect anyone.  Fiona – again, NSG group, don’t think you remember her – was up in the Blue Mountains till there was this whole tension thing with the zombie government in Australia-“

Zombie…government?”

“Oh yeah,” Lia jumps in, “they can like, think and everything.”

“Malcolm Turnbull’s Prime Minister,” Ara adds.  “Ate Tony Abbot in Parliament,” and he can’t help but scoff at the irony.

“So basically,” Lia says, “all the human peeps have been getting together – that’s how Raine met the London guy, Will, he’s like the Minister for Foreign Affairs or something-“

“Assistant Secretary of Foreign Affairs,” Ara mutters.

“- Whatever.  “And he totally got drunk and told her she was hot last Halloween,”

“Relevant, Lia.”

“- Dude, totally.  And then there was this summit, yeah, like in December, and just after that apparently he found out about this whole plan by NATO-“

“Which still exists,” Ara says drily, “despite the fact that like half the member states are zombie-controlled.”

Lia stops, crosses her arms (he remembers that from their relationship, as long as it’s been since then) and glares at Ara.  “Are you telling this or am I?”

“Fairly sure I was, but go ahead,” the taller girl says,",candidate00007
"from Hell.

“I do not answer to you, boy,” Castiel hisses, though her facial muscles remain still, unresponsive to her emotion in the same way Jimmy’s used to be, the first week Castiel spent in that body.  “The girl said yes.  I have every right to be here.”

The younger Winchester flinches away, but Dean throws back his shoulders, meets Castiel’s gaze.  “Come on, man,” he says, and even Castiel is able to discern the forcedness underpinning his casual tone, the tension running through her body.  “Do you really want to be stuck in a chick’s body?  I mean – dude, isn’t she a bit young for you?”

Words are on the tip of her tongue – I am utterly indifferent to gender, I feel no sexual attraction to any being, aged or not – but she bites them back because you are not like them, you are greater than them, they are hairless apes and you are the light of God.

She shakes her head.  “I don’t answer to you,” she repeats.  “Heaven has called Claire Novak to service, and she will serve.  As will you two.”

“But-“ And of course Dean pushes it, stubborn primate that he is.  If this were Jimmy Novak’s body Castiel would have reached out, shoved the human against the wall and shown him his place.  But Claire is small and slim, so instead Castiel splays out a hand, lets her power do the work for her as Dean struggles at the invisible hand pinning him against the dirty brick.

“Enough, Dean.”  From the way Sam claps his hands over his ears and winces, a bit of Castiel’s true voice must have bled through.


Control.  Control.


Dean’s staring at Castiel, no longer struggling against Castiel’s power.  “Please, Cas,” he whispers, cockiness suddenly dissipated.  “She’s just a kid.”

Angelic vessels do not tire, nor do the angels within them.  But a sudden weariness racks Castiel’s Grace, hits her with waves of draining fatigue till all she wants is to return to the Garden, to the peaceful, emotionless tranquillity of Heaven.  “I shall endeavour to find another vessel to hold me,” Castiel finally murmurs, child’s voice barely a wisp of noise in the suddenly quiet room.  “But Claire will hold me till then.”

An echo, please no, please, it hurts, but Castiel silences it with a flicker of thought as she brushes past Sam.

“Where are you going?”

Sam asks quietly.  Castiel doesn’t bother to turn as she responds.  “To do Heaven’s work.  Not yours.”


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

It’s all a flicker of hazy images and memories – like blurred photographs and badly-recorded videos of teenage birthdays – till Dean wakes Castiel up with two hands on her shoulder, trying to shake her till he realises she’s an angel, not a child, and turns away in disgust.

And no, that isn’t true.  Castiel is an angel of the Lord, a creature of the light.  She remembers everything with unrelenting clarity, till something unfamiliar and frightening in her aches with a pain Claire tentatively associates with nausea.

There’s Zachariah gloating as Sam goes crazy, intoxicated by the blood that the demon forces him to crave.

There’s Castiel and the smile, as warm as she can make it but touched by sadness all the same, as she opens the door and lets Sam out.

And then there’s Dean’s rage, palpable and burning (though slightly tempered with confusion whenever he looks in her direction.)

It’s (not) a flicker of hazy images and clear-cut memory till Castiel catches the suddenly sharpening intent in Dean’s mind to strike out at Castiel’s (Claire’s – no, she’s just a child, fricking meatsuit or not goddamnit) face.

That, more than the feeling of warm human skin against her bare shoulders, draws Castiel back into the realisation that this is happening.

That Dean has his hands on Castiel’s shoulders, is stooped over to meet her eyes with a desperately burning rage – and something else, a sort of despairing curiosity, as though he’s looking for something.


Please tell me you’re in there, Cas, c’mon dude, please-


Castiel vanishes in a panicked flutter of wings.  But Dean’s words linger on, teasing at her, and maybe they’re the reason that she ends up on a vast, wide beach on the north-east coast of Australia.  It’s twilight here, and heading into autumn, so the beach is largely deserted, and too dim for any of the humans on the beach to detect her.  Nevertheless, she draws the coat she’s wearing tighter around her –

-And realises for the first time that this is Jimmy Novak’s trenchcoat that she’s wearing, too large and trailing to the ground but somehow still clean.",candidate00007
"blood.

Anyway, she’s sort of off-topic so apparently there’s a thing going on between humans and zombies.

Ara doesn’t sound particularly happy about that, but Alyce isn’t sure whether that’s because she’s going to feel worse about slaughtering tons of them a day (Ara sounds sort of normal on the phone but she’s talked to Raine and Lia and apparently she’s anything but normal) or if it’s because Alice down in Antarctica didn’t tell her about the whole thing.

As far as Alyce knows, the deal works something along the lines of splitting the world in half.  Or ¾ or whatever works.  As far as deals go, she supposes it works.  It’s sort of depressing to realise that she wouldn’t ever be able to see those of her friends who didn’t get turned but then again, she has no idea who’s alive and who isn’t so it’s not too much of a loss.  She knows the cricket lover's somewhere in Germany, but everyone else was in either Australia or somewhere warm (i.e. zombie-fied) when the whole thing went down.

 

~

It’s a complete accident when she hears, day of cricket lover's birthday that they now use as a way to mourn the dead, mourn themselves, and watch Star Wars on repeat till they fall asleep.

She totally doesn’t mean to; she’s making a pit stop at one of the convenience stores that’s reopened for Oreos so she can make that cake she made once before for a Star Wars marathon too many years before.

“…And you don’t think that’s too bold?”

Alyce doesn’t know what makes her duck around the corner when she hears that voice.  Maybe it’s the fact that it’s cold, passionless, sort of like Palpatine but more boring, and therefore somehow much more evil.

A laugh, fake and humourless.  “Why does it matter? We know they’re planning on betraying the agreement, after all; we need to make the first move, and if that involves eradicating the last of the human presence” – he spits the word human as though he never was one – “then we will do it.”

Blue Mountains, Alyce thinks, and then shit.

She doesn’t understand why, but all she knows is that it’s happening.  That the unturned are going to trust and trust and then before they have time to swallow the betrayal they’ll be dead.

Like the Jedi children but not as fictional,

The phone rings five times and then goes to voicemail, with the same annoying chick that she swears every single phone company used for the same recording.  “Hey, um, this is Alyce-“ Alyce begins, only to be cut off by a loud beep.

“Your voice message is being transcribed and will be sent as a message.  Have a good day.”

Damn it.

Sighing, she scrolls aimlessly through her contacts, not really seeing any of the names – she tried, after all, that’s all she had to do, she can’t feel guilty now…

A name leaps out at her, glaring and obvious, like it’s suddenly branded into her brain or something.

Lia.

Ara’s friend in the Netherlands, she thinks.  The one with the satellite phone, whose number Alice gave her in case of emergencies, whatever that means.

Alyce doesn’t have to.  She knows she doesn’t have to; fricking hell, she’s not even human anymore, it’s not like she owes them, she tried to call Fio and nothing happened-

All it takes for evil to happen is for good men to do nothing.

“Gaaaah.”

It’s probably the whole zombie thing that leaves her empty hand trembling by her side as she presses Call, green and innocent when it should be red and flashing with Do Not Touch.

“Heello?  It’s Lia.” 

The voice is breathless, like the other person had to run to make the phone.  Alyce wonders idly in the midst of painful, knotting terror, whether that might have been better for everyone her.


And was it the whole zombie thing that made her this selfish, or was she always like this?


“Hello?”

She can just hang up.  She doesn’t have to do

 I have to tell you something, and it’s important,” Alyce’s mouth says.  Well, there goes that.

“Sorry, um, who is this?” 

“Alyce.  I’m one of Ara’s friends?”

“Ohh…the…”

She rolls her eyes.  “Yeah, the zombie.”

“Lia?  Who is it?”  It’s a guy’s voice, a guy who sounds vaguely familiar.  Her first thought is Loki, Avengers, hahaha, and then oh yeah, Fio said…and then eww, so that’s why she was",candidate00007

III.


So after Banner and Steve have both stopped blushing, and Clint has stopped weeping (you’re not sure if that’s from the shock of reliving his trauma or from the fact that said trauma’s now officially going to be the subject of Stark’s merciless mockery at least the next few days), you try for a shift in mood; or at least, for something doesn’t immediately fall under the category of embarrassing.

It’s hard, but you’ll have time to tell those stories later.

Afghanistan, 1987; and for the first time, you’re not paying attention to anyone else’s reaction.  Instead, you meet his eyes, knowing that he’s thinking the same thing you are.

(And this is beyond normal levels of drunk if you’re willingly D&Ming with Clint.)

(And of course you don’t tell the truth this time, because there are some things that Steve and Thor and Banner and even Stark, that unethical but terrifyingly moral prick, couldn’t understand.)

(But you think it, and you know he’s thinking it too.)

This is just after you’ve given up on the Soviet Union.

Unfortunately, the Soviet Union hasn’t given up on itself; and you’re forcing yourself to wait it out till that finally happens; so you’re in that lovely awkward position where the Soviet Union thinks you’re still totally into them, and the United States are positive you’re on the right side.

And clearly, neither of them know how to court a girl, and so instead of the gifts and flowers that you totally deserve in exchange for perhaps eventually deciding to swing in favour of one or the other, you find yourself placed in charge of defending Tohir Yo’ldosh, some obsequious sadistic toad of a local politician.

It works out fine for the first few months (you help the more respectable political prisoners escape at night, and he pretends not to notice because any protection is better than none).

(Of course, Clint has to come along to fuck it all up.)

“Agent Romanova, what do you think?” Yo’ldosh asks you in heavily accented Russian, smarmy smile twisting his lips.

You idiot, is what you’re thinking, staring at Clint as he leans heavily against the wall of the tiny interrogation room.  “He’s not going to speak,” you quietly respond.

The man chuckles, a horrible grating sound.  “Well,” he begins, “I am certain that-“

“I’ve encountered Agent Barton before,” you say quickly – too quickly, and you berate yourself briefly for it – “he’s not going to speak.”

But sadists are sadists, and it takes two hours of listening to Clint scream as you watch, impassive, before Yo’ldosh concedes defeat.

“I suppose you are right, Agent Romanova,” he sighs petulantly – in English, this time, even more horribly mangled than his Russian, and you know he wants Clint to hear him.

Somehow, through the blood and bruising and broken bones, Clint’s mouth curves in a smile, “Damn straight,” he rasps out, before biting straight through his lip when Yo’ldosh delivers a kick to his shattered left thigh.

“I truly wish it did not have to come to this,” the man says, false sincerity oozing from every pore.  He turns his head.  “Bring the girl in!” he shouts.

The girl is fourteen.  She’s bruised and bewildered.

She’s Yo’ldosh’s niece.

~~~~~

Alright so it turns out this puffed-up little ingrate is actually crazier than you thought; as in, he transcends sane crazy and makes it into genuine Freudian insanity with room to spare.

“Talk and we will let you go” (lie – you know very well that Yo’ldosh had already ordered the shallow grave for Clint’s body to be dug) “or do not talk…and I will get angry.” 

He shrugs.  “And perhaps you will be hurt” (some more) “or perhaps,” you see the girl (Fila, her name is) flinch from his touch, and that’s when you know he’s already raped her, “someone else will.  She is my sister’s child.  I would not like to see her dead, but there are things we must do for our country.”

You very carefully keep your expression blank.

But that’s another thing, like swimming, that he obviously never learned.

The politician sneers when Clint’s eyes widen.  “Ah yes, your American sense of justice.  I am appealing to your American sense of justice, Mr…what did you say his name was, Agent Romanova?”

“Barton,” you reply (not numbly, calmly.  You can’t afford to go numb now, you know.)

“Barton,” he says with a smile.  “Your Western sense of honour.  “Oh, I will let you go,” Yo",candidate00007

He jumped and turned around to snap at Uma but before he Could He got thrown over Gil shoulder, One of the reasons He was On Uma crew was because he was so strong. It also helped that Harry basically weighted next to nothing.  ""Gil- put me down you bastard!"" Harry yelled, Hiting Gil back with a bright red face. All he got for a response was another slap on his ass. He yelped and Stared at Uma, who had a small smile on her face. He could tell he wasn't gonna get put down so he glumy Rested his chin on his hand, and Said ""What the hell are you guys doing?"" He didn't have the entry to yell at them. ""Well Babe-we're gonna cheer you up!"" Gil said cheerfully and Harry could only Groan as the Blond headed boy Let Uma lead him to Her room. Harry On the way had dozed off, It was clear to The two Villans Because they could hear him snoring. Gil looked at Uma who said ""Well Gil, Im trusting you to Help me Help him."" Gil nodded and Said sadly ""I wish he wouldn't do this..."" Uma nodded as she opened her door. ""My mother isn't home today- she's gonna be gone till next week."" She explained and Gil nodded. He carefully set the Sleeping Pirate on her bed, Hardy curled up in a little ball and kept sleeping. Uma sat next to him and Dragged Gil down. They both looked at Harry and Then they nodded at each other. ""Harry..Wake up."" Uma commanded in a Tone that She only had with Harry and Gil. Harry stirred and Said ""A couple more minutes.""

When Gil kissed him Harry rolled over so he was on top on Gil and kissed him pastionly, The both of them were so into it They didn't notice Uma getting up and then said ""Now now Gil- you can't let him do all the work. Remember?"" Harry Looked at Her with a confused look as His other lover nodded. ""Yes Uma!"" Gil said and then Uma smiled. ""Huh?""

His hands started to slowly strip the Pirate. Uma sat down and Watched with a amused look. Harry Let him? He didn't feel like he had enough energy to stop it. But when Gil hands went to his pants He Tensed up and Hissed. Gil looked at him and Took his pants off,leaving him in only his boxers. Gil started to strip to, But only when he got a nod From Uma. Even when Gil was doing all the work Uma was still in charge. Harry couldn't decide to find jr attractive or To controlling. Gil Held Harry arms and Kissed over the bandages then ripped them off easily. Harry Wimpered when he felt Gil lips on his cuts. Gil could fell Uma eyes on them, he could almost hear her say ""Put on a good show for Me Gil-Make Harry feel Like he's the most important person there is."" And when ever Uma commanded something Gil did what she said. Gil Pulled Harry Up so both men were on their knees and Kissed him, His hands slowly Taking off the Other boy's boxers so he was naked. Gil noticed that Harry was blushing, he could almost laugh. Here he was, being all Shy about his body. They all saw each other naked Before-They all had sex with each other countless times. Then Gil realized something: it didn't matter who it was with, Harry was always top. So maybe Harry for once wanted to Not be in control, forced to beg..forced To Be weak. He found that Image strangely hot-not that he was gonna say that. Gil kissed Harry hard and slipped his tounge into his mouth, his hands Grabbing at The Boyd's hair and tugging at it, getting a moan from the son of Hook. Gil looked over and Uma and thought "" Harry's into this Pain? His kink is pain?!?"" Uma nodded as she  Leaned back into her chair, watching the show Unfold.

"all and that's that. 




He had went to the doctor's after school, despite his father saying he was fine. But after the boy had shown his father the petals His father had taken him to the doctor. It was quiet as he was in the hallway, He was sitting in a chair with his head down. His father was inside the office talking to the doctor. The two words still was Ringing in Ethan's head. Hanahaki disease. The name sounded pretty sure but this wasn't pretty at all. Why him, Ethan didn't dersve this. All he wanted was love, He gave his heart to another but Didn't get it in return. That was the problem. He had gotten it From loving Jason, who loved Piper. It was all his fault. From what Ethan could hear though the door there was ways to get it out, The only two options were Love back or surgery. Either way It wasn't gonna happen. Sure, Ethan's father had tons of money but it all went to his younger sister, Who had cancer. 


Ethan coughed and looked at the petals in his hands. ""What now?'' Will asked as Nico Took a sip out of his coffee. The five of them were hanging out in star bucks, Just Will, Nico, Ethan, Luke and Hazel. Ethan shrugged and wiped his mouth. ""Man you need hearing aids. I said I have the Hanahaki disease, which by the way means I have flowers and roots in me.""' Ethan shrugged again. His friends just gaped at him and he rubbed the back of his neck. ""But how do you get it?'' Luke questioned, He already knew but Ethan had a feeling he was helping him tell what had to be said, and for that The one eyed boy was grateful. ""When you love someone so much and they don't feel the same.'' He replied quietly. Hazel put her hand over his hand and smiled, but it was full of pity and sadness. ""I could get them removed surgery but then I will never feel love again.'' He muttered and felt all his friend's eyes on him. Before anyone could say something Ethan erupted into violent coughing, He coughed right into his hands and looked at them sadly. Blood was covering the petals. ""Et, You have to tell Jason! He-''

""Might return the feelings then? Bull. It's utter bullshit Will.'' Ethan muttered and wiped his mouth. His coffee sat there growing cold as He felt himself dying. ""I want nothing to do with...With..Jason at the moment.'' He didn't miss the way his voice caught on his name. No matter what he told himself he still Loved Jason Grace. What a cruel joke on him. ""Ethan...can't you...I don't know..'' Hazel asked and Ethan looked at her, One of his best friends. He smiled and shrugged. ""Who knows?'' He felt horrible for doing this. He was basically letting himself die right in front of them.


 He had nightmares. Where he would wake up and find himself covered in petrels, find roots growing out of him. He would always wake up in a cold sweat, Gasping and curled up in a ball. His younger sister didn't understand. He would just pat her head and smile. ""I'm fine Yuri, Just a little sickness.'' And she would look up at him with her bright green eyes wide. ""A sickness?'' She asked in a quiet voice. And this is the part where it killed Him. He would get on his knees and hold her close and blinked away tears. '""Yeah, I'll be fine soon so you don't worry at all Yuri.'' He didn't want to lie to her, But he had to Lie, he didn't want her to worry. She was only eight and already was sentenced with a horrible fate. Her mother had die when she was only five when their mother died, Ethan and her were driving home from his Karate match when a drunk driver crashed into them. Ethan lost a eye, and Their mother had lost her life. 



Life was cruel. 


""Ethan please, we can help.'' Will pleaded and the other three nodded. Ethan felt his heart break and he shrugged. They couldn't help, unless They somehow made Jason love him they couldn't do a single thing. And that was beautiful. Ethan looked at his phone and lied to their faces, he had said his father wanted him home. It wasn't that good of a lie but his friends let him go. It was raining so he put his hood up as he walked. His mind started to Travel to Jason and he shook his head. It was not the time nor place to think about the boy who was killing him without even realizing it. He stopped at the cross walk and looked up at the rainy sky. He hands were in his pockets and he had the sudden urge to walk in the traffic.",candidate00008
"said. ""I wanted to come back a little early. Why are you crying."" Luke asked,wrapping his arms around Ethan,who cuddled into him. ""Nightmare,Not a big deal."" Ethan reassured. Luke Just Said ""Spill."" Ethan sighed and said ""You know that One dream I had-The one with the fields of Punishment and Place for heroes? Had it again."" Luke hugged him tighter. ""Don't worry Et, it won't happen. I promise."" Luke said. ""What ever."" Ethan muttered. He listened to Luke's heart,Which for some reason Always calmed him down. Luke started to Fool around with Ethan's eyepatch. ""Cutie."" Luke said. Et closed his eye. ""Shut up. Your talking about yourself."" He murmured. Luke laughed and kissed Et's forehead. ""Noooo, I'm talking about you my kitten."" Luke said and Laughed even more at the look on Ethan face. ""I hate you."" Ethan swore and Kissed Luke. ""Now go to sleep ya stupid big Blond."" He added as Luke rolled his eyes. ""Alright Kitten."" Luke said and closed His eyes, He felt Ethan slowly Relax but Didn't go to sleep. He sighed and said ""Et, Want me to make some coffee?"" Ethan just Said ""I can do it."" Luke opened his eyes and kissed Ethan. ""Fine, But I'm putting in a movie."" Luke said and Ethan laughed. So they ended on the couch,Ethan Cuddling up to Luke, Their drinks-Tea for Ethan and Coffee for Luke-on the table, Watching a stupid movie, something Animated. ""But Et, That won't happen."" Luke said. ""I'll hold you to that."" Ethan said. Both of them watched movies until Morning.

Ethan felt warm arms around him. He groaned and snuggled to Luke. ""Hey Et, ya gotta get up."" Luke said, trying not to laugh at the smaller boy. He had a massive case of bed head and his eyepatch was crooked. ""I don't want to."" Ethan muttered into Luke's chest. Luke kissed his cheek. ""I know baby but ya gotta."" He said. Ethan yawned and got off of His boyfriend. He looked outside and saw it was snowing. ""It's snowing."" He stated. Luke laughed. ""You act like you never saw Snow before?"" He questioned. ""I have."" Ethan said and got up, before Large arms wrapped around his waist and pulled him back down. ""Luke! I thought you said we have to get up!"" Ethan groaned blushing softly. Luke cuddled him. ""Just a couple more minutes?"" He pleaded. ""Fine."" Ethan said, hiding his smile

Snow falling on him, he reached up and grabbed the only hand that helped him. The only hand that wanted him, needed him. With the snow mixed in with tears on his face he smiled and welcomed the hand,the arms that wrapped around him. He knew what the arms meant, they welcomed him. All he ever wanted was to let Kids not be like him, forced to Go to the bad side just so he could change the world. As he got pulled up he smiled at his only friend, the only friend that didn't care who he was the son of, didn't care about his race or eyepatch, just a friend. The snow faded and He realized where he was, a crystal beach, a place for heroes. He was a hero. Him and his best friend. He smiled and the arm, then at the body and then the face. ""Hey Luke."" He said,chocking up a little. Luke smiled and said ""hey Et, we lost."" Ethan nodded. ""But were here now, maybe the gods will change?"" Like said and Ethan smiled. ""Now and forever right?""  Ethan said. Both boys fell and started to laugh, then sob. But they were here together. That all that matter

Ethan Nakamura Remembered Exactly how he felt when he came to Hogwarts, he was scared, Nervous and A tad Pissed. One-WHY DIDNT ANY ONE TELL HIM HE WAS A WIZARD?!? Two, He doubted any one else had a eyepatch and Third, You would be nervous to if you found out your a wizard. He remembered Walking up to the Hat and Hearing ""Griffendor!"" He remembered Walking to the table and getting claps on the back. What Ethan will never remember Is a blond 3rd year slytherin boy watching him. Ethan Was still nervou, Atfer all this was all new to him. but he was shocked at the food that appeared-of course The kid could only think ""Magic ain't it?"" He could only stare with his mouth watering,until a black haired boy nudged him. ""Hey..you can eat dude."" The boy said and Piled Some weird looking food on Ethan plate. ""What..what is this?"" Ethan asked poking the food with his fork. The boy laughed. """,candidate00008
"He loved her, He loved her so much it hurts. A pain In his heart when ever she Smiled, He grew dizzy When she laughed. She was his light, and he was Her King. He loved her ever since He saw her. It took years,But he finally asked her out, she loved him back. When ever they could they would Hug. Sometimes Charlie Would sneak Into her cabin and they would Sit on the roof, Where they hugged and Kissed. Both were happy until He had to go, He had to go and Help with the war. She sobbed and Hit him, Until he wrapped his large arms around her and Said ""Ill come back."" Over and over Into her hair. He felt her tears soak his shirt, He knew deep down that he wouldn't come back. But he wasn't gonna tell her that. He told Her that he loved her, That she was His princess and He wouldn't ever leave her. She nodded and Charlie said ""I have a gift for you when I come back."" ""I want to go with you."" She said,Her voice was cracking. He nodded and smiled, then his princess kissed him-for the last time- and ran off. He almost broke down but never less  Left to get Percy. The whole time he was thinking ""You gave to come back, You will NOT die."" When he got caught He knew what to do. As his hand went to his watch he thought ""Im sorry Princess."" His last image was Selena Sitting on the dock, Her hair Over her shoulder as She held back a laugh, Her smile even beating the Sun. 

She didn't believe him, She couldn't face the truth though, She wanted to believe him but She knew the risks. It was likely He would die. She kissed him for the last time and Ran off. She cried For hours when she found out,Her king was dead. Nothing could make her feel better. When The Ares Cabin followed her into Battle, She thought of her King, Her Charlie. When the acid hit her She was proud, She proved that Her cabin- the cabin of Love could fight. As she closed her eyes on The mortal world they called Earth she thought of Her King. Charlie, I want to see you.

When both The female and Male opened their eyes, They were in each other arms. ""My princess."" Charlie Coked out as Selena hugged him. ""My king."" She said, her Tears Covering her beautiful Smile. ""My princess."" He began and Bent down on one knee. They could be together forever now. He brought a small box out of His pocket and said ""My princess, I love you until the stars end. My heart Pumps for you and you only. Let spend Entiry together."" He opened it and Put the ring on his Princess finger. They both started to cry  as Selina said ""I love you."" 

Later on, on the shores of the Place for Heroes, They kissed and Welcomed each other.",candidate00008
"That fucking Jew Was lying and Cartman knew it. So he was sitting down in front of Seven eleven Glaring at the ground with his arms shoving tons of food into his mouth. He kept cussing at everyone who passed him, no matter who it was. He just wanted that damn Car and he wanted it NOW. But his mom told him that he probably just misplaced it, so Cartman called her a bitch and then left, so here he was...in front of seven eleven... looking stupid. He was so mad and to busy stuffing his face to notice A boy with red and black hair sit next to him. ""Fucking Damn it! That's my Car!! I want my carrrrrr!!!!"" He cried.""What a pussy.. it's not even a real car."" Cartman looked around and when he saw the boy he Said ""Shut up shut up!!"" The boy flipped his hair and pulled out a cigarette. ""Alright."" He said as he lit it and the two of them sat in Total quiet until the boy said ""What's your name any ways?"" Cartman looked at him. ""I'm Cartman."" He answered in his Annyoning voice. ""I'm Pete."" The boy flipped his hair again and Cartman said ""Why are you bugging me?"" Pete sighed. ""You were yelling at Everyone and I couldn't smoke in peace you poser."" Cartman eyes went wide. ""What did you call me?!"" Pete snickered. ""A poser."" He answered. ""You fucker!!"" Cartman yelled as pete snickered again. ""Your being a baby over something stupid."" Cartman Growled. ""That's a lie! My car was amazing! Take that back you bitch!"" Pete looked at him and said ""Listen poser, Its just a car- a toy car. I literally don't see how it's so important."" Cartman threw himself on the ground and threw his limbs about. ""Shut up shut up shut up shut up!!!!"" Pete Looked at him. ""What ever."" He said and didn't pay any attention to the fat boy throwing his fit until He yelled ""fuck off Emo!!"" Pete's head snapped up as he glared at him. ""What?"" He said. ""You heard me!! Your acting like your life sucks! Mine is so much worse! I lost my toy!"" Cartman wailed. Pete glared at him and said ""Really now? Your life sucks!?"" Cartman nodded. Pete took a deep breath. ""Listen Fatty- just sit down and calm down."" Cartman shockily listened and sat back down. They both sat in quiet again as Pete kept smoking. Eric looked at him and said ""Your fucking stupid emo!"" Pete eye's twitched and he didn't look at him.  ""Listen...Cartman. How important is this toy to you?"" Cartman looked at him. ""Like really Important!"" He yelled and Pete Flinched. ""Don't yell poser, your hurting my ears. And if you want To get a new car then here."" The goth shoved Some cash into his Hands and Went back to smoking. ""Aw thanks dude!"" Eric said, he had already decided that he was gonna use that money to get food. ""Sucker!"" Eric thought as Pete started to talk ""I'm not emo.. Emos and goths are different, don't ask why cause I can't explain. And your throwing a fit over a toy? I know it's special to you but you have it good."" Cartman looked at him and said ""shut up Fag."" Pete eye twitched again and he said ""You have it really good. You have a house with a loving mom"" Eric rolled his eyes. ""Shut up emo!"" He said. Pete glared at him and Said ""Listen... Cartman... your mom loves you right? I don't get that. My mom... She left me."" Cartman looked at him. ""My dad And I live along....in a shitty Trailor, I smoke and do Drugs."" Cartman eyes went wide a little. ""Life sucks ass"" he said and Cartman got a idea. ""Life sucks ass right?"" He said. Pete nodded and Blew some Smoke into the sky. ""You wonder why I'm goth? I hate the world, The world hasn't been nice to me."" Pete said and cartman looked at him. He opned his mouth to say something But Pete cut him off. ""Oh look..I'm Eric Boo hoo hoo, my Mom spoilers me shit less and I get every thing i want!"" He mocked. Cartman Growled. ""Shut up emo!"" Pete flipped his hair. ""I'm Pete and I'm goth- I hate everything in this world and wouldn't you know! I have a shitty life compared to The god we all know as Eric Fucking Cartman!""  Then He threw his cigarette on the ground and pulled up his sleeves and showed some scars. ""HA! You at emo!"" Cartman yelled. Pete smiled and shook his head. ""Nope,",candidate00008
"quiet on the ship. 

""Fine.'' Cartman said, his greed winning over sense. Kenny smiled and the game began, Each was playing for a life. Each was aiming to win

okay guys! chapter two! So i'm planning on updating every week- HAHAHAHAHA- so this fan fic was inspired by the amazing Kenny Chan, legit my best friend ever On the internet. They helped me get this idea so thank you Kenny. I also want to say this: I know nothing about card games so I made one up. thank you

It was quiet as the game went on, All was quiet besides the sounds of water hitting wood, the shuffling of cards and the breathing of the ship inhabitants. The crew of the ship were cluttered around the wooden table, their eyes switching  from the two captains. Back and forth, Back and forth, back and forth. And the game went on. Some times the two captains would cuss when they picked up cards, sometimes smirking as they picked up the cards. They would look at their cards for a minute then put two down. Back and forth, Back and forth, back and forth.  And so the game went on, it was quiet as they played. The tension was high, The pressure heavy. Both were playing for a life, both playing for their fate. And so the game went on.

Kenny knew he had to win, If he failed not only would the merman die, no doubt die a painful death, But Kenny would have to work for Eric for the rest of his life- being a slave for the cruel pirate. If he won, on the other hand, He would get the merman, and to get the half fish that would mean he could get to the Spring of Youth, and that would mean he could become immortal!  And so the game went on, The pressure was weighing down on the blond, crushing him lower and lower. The only thing that was fueling him to win besides the thought of Being immortal was the thought of having to call Cartman ""Captain"" for the rest of his life. And that was enough to give even the toughest of Pirates nightmares. AT that moment Kenny only cared about himself, Not the merman, not his crew. But Himself. He wanted- no, he was determined to win. He wanted to become a living being that never died, He wanted to Prove he was a god, Wanted to show everyone who doubted him that they were wrong. And so the game went on, It was so much more of a game- It was destiny. Unknown to Kenny it was fate that Cartman had caught the merman, It was destiny that Kenny would play this game.


A long time ago, before Pirates began to travel across the seas, In a deep deep cave on a land long forgotten there was a tribe. This tribe were Called Jengibre, or gingers. They lived in caves and trees, They're long gone now. Hunted to their deaths. They were peaceful beings, who spoke to the gods themselves. They didn't have paper at the time so they drew their Visions on caves walls.  And so they drew, using paint they made. Long ago They had a vision and it went like this:



A pirate who was clad in orange and hair golden as the sun would find a map,one that would lead to immortality. A Pirate as cruel as death itself would catch a boy of water. The orange clad Pirate and the Cruel Pirate would cross fates on night. They would gamble On the water boy, playing for his life. Only one would win. Only one would lose. The winner got the boy and they at once traveled to the spring of youth. However There, at the place of forever life, There would have-


It was quiet as the game went on, All was quiet on the ship. Fate was being tested, Destiny was being tempted. A life for another, A chance to become Young forever. And so the game went on, This time unlike the other times... For this was a game of life Kenny put down a five, then picked up an Ace. He was sweating softly, The eyes watching him did nothing to calm The Pirate's nerves. He watched Hopelessly as Cartman Put down a five and a ten. It was clear That Kenny was playing a game already won. And so the game went on, back and forth, back and forth. Kenny wiped his forehead with his sleeve and blinked, trying to remain calm. 

""Why did you have to wager your life on a stupid fish! If You lose it's good bye to living forever and hello to washing Eric feet!''  Fear yelled, Kenny at once flinched. Cartman's crew shared a small look but Kenny didn't care. Not one bit But then logic came in and calmly said ""Relax, you already have an Ace, three, and six. All you need is another Ace. You can do this if you remain calm.'""  Kenny took a deep breath and nodded. And so he held onto Hope",candidate00008
"her. They could both Handle a level E-every vampire could basically handle a level E. They both stood up and Fula growled. ""He ruined my outfit."" She said. Kain just looked at her a little amazed. He looked at the Level E- a man who was covered-no, Soaking- in blood. His eyes were full of lust, not for sex. But for blood. ""So this is who caused this mess.."" Kain said as the Level E laughed. ""More more more!"" He sang. Kain Was disgusted at the Level E. His hands Were filled with Fire and he said ""you make me sick."" He didn't sense any one else around. Good, he didn't have to deal with Wiping Human memories. ""Ruka stand back."" He said. Ruka stood back as Kain flew some fire at the Level E,who kept dodging. Kain Growled as Ruka Decided to step in. ""Over here!"" She yelled. The monster looked at her,Then level E dove at her and Kain yelled ""No!"" He reached for Her as the Level E hands went though her. She screamed as The monster dove right though her. Kain Yelled in anger and He let loose a power he didn't know he had: he shot So much fire at the monster that at once The Level E was evaporated. Kain Fell to his knees and said ""Ruka..."" then he felt a hand on his shoulders. ""Kain-did you forget I can make illusions?"" Ruka asked. Kain looked at her and Wiped away the tears he didn't even notice he was shedding. ""Y-yeah."" He said,standing up. He smiled at Ruka right before he felt a pain in his stomach. ""Huh...?"" He said looking down, he didn't notice the blood dripping out his mouth. He didn't notice The fear in Ruka wide eyes. But what he did notice was the pair of hands jutting out of his stomach. ""Wha...?"" He asked and then collapsed. ""Kain!"" Ruka Yelled. ""I'm f-fine."" Kain said and Struggled to get up. He saw more vampires-ten at least. How did he not notice them?!! When he got up He said ""I'm...fine Ruka."" Ruka looked at him and smiled. ""Good! Your not allowed to die on me Kain! You hear that?"" She said. Kain smiled back and wiped his mouth. ""Yes...Ruka."" He said as Both of them started to fight the vampires-Kain kept taking all the hits. He didn't want Ruka to get hurt at all. Finally all the vampires were dead-long gone. ""Adios suckers"" Kain thought. ""Pardon the...pun..."" he added in his head as He slowly sunk to the ground. ""Kain?!?"" Ruka asked crouching next to him. He looked at her and Lifted a hand to her cheek. ""Your...your beautiful..."" he said. He saw Ruka was crying. ""H-hey...don't...don't cry."" He said. ""You can't die! Your fine!"" Ruka said, hitting his chest. Kain coughed and Looked into her eyes, he decided he had to do this. Using what strength he had he grabbed her and kissed her on the lips. Both of them were crying. Kain didn't get to see what happened next-his eyes closed and his breathing stopped. But before he could fully Vanish he said ""I love you Ruka..."" then everything went dark

Ruka was screaming, She was screaming so loud that People came over to see what happened. She was Holding her Knees to her chest and sobbing. She didn't even know it but She loved Kain-and know he was gone. Kain...was gone. Ruka kept crying and yelled ""go away!"" She didn't even care if she was rude.""Just get away!"" In the end Kaname had to come get her, She didn't know how he knew where she was. Some one must had called the school. It was a sad thing really...The one person she thought she loved was the one who came and got her. Not the man She really did love. Kaname Put her to sleep and Watched over her slumbering body. When she awoke She had to tell the story-had to relive what happened. During it Aido cried. Kaname did cry to. But not Ruka-she didn't want to appear weak. She didn't want pity. She didn't want any one to Pity her. At the funeral She had to deal with more crying. She slowly walked up to The coffin That would Have held Her lover and she broke down. Right there and Then. She just collapsed and she sobbed. She Hit the coffin. ""Your stupid! You could have Lived if you weren't so damn stupid!"" She screamed. Everyone looked at the Vampire who was clad in black but she didn't care. Her lover was gone. She",candidate00008
". He’s focused, more so than Laxus has seen him in a long time.

‘More,’ he says rather than asks, seeming a little dazed but also hungry. Laxus still hasn’t pulled back, strangely transfixed by this intense, calm Natsu who’s somehow shifted closer to him without him noticing. He’s beginning to feel a slight drain on his magic, but he lets the younger Dragon Slayer continue eating without even thinking about it. But then Natsu stops and looks up at him. Wide black eyes, entirely too close. Pink hair is almost in his face.

‘Laxus, I want more.’ Natsu licks his lips, a devious grin spreading over them. He stands up on his toes, even now noticeably shorter than the guildmaster’s grandson, and kisses Laxus. Whatever he’d been expecting, this wasn’t it. Natsu kisses greedily and without restraint and he finds himself responding even as muted alarm bells go off in his head. He knows he should probably stop here, while he still has the presence of mind to do so, but this is one battle he doesn’t hate losing. Natsu is stubborn and all but makes the decision for him, pressing himself tightly against Laxus’ body and placing flaming hot lips over his. His magic is being drained vigorously but there’s plenty more where that came from and he stops holding back.

Oi, oi, oi..he thinks to himself. When the hell did Natsu get this good at kissing? There was tongue, slipping expertly between his lips and teeth, not being denied entrance, taste unearthly and unlike anything Laxus has ever known. He had been eating fire and lightning merely seconds ago and it’s still crackling on his tongue a little.

Now he’s getting fired up too. He’s letting his magic pour out freely; he’s kissing Natsu back, but better. He’s not going to just stand there like a loser, he’s not afraid to take action. He’d cooled off lately, his temper reined in by the guild and life experience, but his stubborn and feisty attitude flares up again. He straightens up, towering over the younger Dragon Slayer. Natsu stills, eyes wide and wild, a little startled. There is a pause and each of them has a chance to catch their breath. Laxus grabs him, large hands easily grasping his shoulders and places him against the wall. He thinks Natsu’s legs might have given way because he wobbles a little, his hair sticking up in odd directions and his lips are red and swollen. He looks overwhelmed and absolutely delectable.

“Changed your mind?” he challenges, but Natsu is already grinning back at him.

“You wish!” he reaches forward and pulls Laxus in by the shirt. There is fire and electricity around them and they’ll probably break everything within reach but somehow Laxus finds he doesn’t particularly care. His gramps can complain all he wants about them wrecking the rebuilt Guild hall later, but now his priority is getting his hands all over Natsu’s well-toned body and everything else can go to hell.

The younger Dragon Slayer seems just as eager because he’s begun eating Laxus’ lightning magic again, shuddering with excitement. He rips off Laxus’ shirt, grabbing a fistful of the dark material and pulling hard. Not to be outdone, Laxus peels off the scarf and the jacket off him with little preamble, fingers glancing over the Fairy Tail mark on his right shoulder briefly. 

Natsu’s body is covered with a surprising number of scars and burns for someone with both amazing recuperative powers and a virtual immunity to fire. It’s a reminder of all the battles he’s fought and won and of every bit of strength hiding in his body that he’s worked so hard for and damn, it makes Laxus want him that much more.

He wants to completely overwhelm Natsu, wants to show him a taste of magic more intense than anything he could have imagined. He lets the greedy Salamander consume everything, till the last drop. Natsu’s eyes roll back in pleasure and a distinct moan escapes him.

‘…Fuck,’ Laxus hears himself saying. He’s really feeling the drain now, but it’s worth the effort, he thinks, when he sees Natsu’s eyes glazed over with pleasure, shivering in his grasp and arch back as much as the narrow space allows. He looks completely out of it.

‘Wanna stop?’ it pains him to ask, because he’s horny as fuck.

‘Tch. Don’t underestimate me,’ Natsu bites him, but at the same time his legs give up and he’s left practically pinned to the wall by Laxus’ strength alone. He’s fumbling with the zipper of Laxus’ trousers then and doesn’t waste time, stroking his hard length with a grin on his face.

His hand makes a visible dent in the wall where his fingers dig into it with the effort of holding them both up, but Laxus barely registers it. Natsu’s fingers aren’",candidate00009
"another day.

 

The plan for the trip consisted of the teachers taking the entire class of about 20 kids camping in the nearby woods, some minor survival training and team exercises. It was nothing too complicated and there was virtually no danger to them in the forest, but to the aspiring little ninjas this was incredibly exciting.

‘I wonder if I brought enough snacks,’ Chouji wondered aloud, while they stood around in front of the school.

‘I’ve got tons of ramen, I’ll share with you!’ Naruto grinned at his friend.

‘I just hope it doesn’t rain, I want to get some sleep…’ Shikamaru yawned. Someone bumped into him, but he was too tired to bother turning around to see who it was. Whatever.

‘Is everyone ready?’ Iruka-sensei called out, gathering everyone’s attention. ‘We’re leaving in five minutes so make sure you haven’t left anything behind!’

‘What a drag..’

‘Ehh? Where’s my bag?’ Naruto blinked confusedly. He was sure it had been sitting right behind him!

‘Did you forget it at home?’ Chouji munched on a chip.

‘He had it with him when he arrived… obviously someone took it,’ Shikamaru cringed. Naruto was already running off.

‘I’m gonna go look for it! Don’t leave without me, dattebayo!’ the blonde dashed back to the Academy.

He noticed it on the teacher’s desk in their usual classroom.

‘Huh? It’s just sitting there?’ He ran up to grab it (not before making sure all the ramen was still there). He’d only just picked it up when the door to the room slammed shut and locked with an audible click.

‘What? Hey, I’m still in here!’ Let me out!’ Naruto cried, running up the door just in time to ear an ominous giggling fading into the distance.

 

Ami and her gang must have finally got bored of picking on Sakura… Naruto clenched his fists. She’d left him alone this long, so why now! He threw the bag back down on the floor in frustration. It was no use, Ami was mean just because she loved being mean, there was never anything else to it. She’d always been a bully, even before they started school.

 

‘I bet they’ve finished roll call now,’ he ran to the window, looking down at the courtyard. There was no one left there. He was going to miss the trip! Even more importantly, he was trapped in the classroom.

The door was definitely locked tight and wouldn't even budge when he pushed it. Even when he eventually managed to climb up on the window sill, he couldn’t reach the handle to open the window. What felt like hours passed, while Naruto stared hopelessly out of the window. No one was even coming by to help, he was going to stay in this empty room forever. He didn’t even notice when he’d started crying until he suddenly couldn’t calm down at all.

‘Help! Someone!’ he involuntarily hiccuped. His nose was running now too. ‘Help!’

The door flew off it’s hinges, startling him into silence.

‘Thought I heard some crying brat making a racket.’ Hidan waltzed in, arms crossed and a displeased scowl on his face. ‘Thought I’d stop by to have a word with the teach about the nonsense they tea- ugh whatever. Why are you in here?’

‘I wasn’t crying,’ Naruto said quickly and wiped the tears and snot from his face with the end of his sleeve. Hidan’s eye twitched.

‘Uh-huh.’

‘I just..forgot my bag in here..dattebayo’ Naruto trailed off, unsure how to explain everything. ‘Ami was just being mean as always..’

‘I think I see where this is going.’ Hidan could just sacrifice the little bitch to Jashin - problem solved - but this did seem a little heavy-handed, all things considered. He was supposed to be on a secret mission or whatever. Pein came up with some shitty plans.

‘You should prank the hell out of her later,’ he shrugged.

Naruto grinned, even though his face was still puffy from crying. But the happy expression vanished just as quickly as it appeared.

‘I’ve missed the trip.. They went on without me,’ he confessed to Hidan, looking at his feet.

‘What are you talking about?’ Shikamaru’s voice rang out and the boy peeked into the room. ‘Sensei’s downstairs, looking for you while everyone waits inside. It started raining.’ The young Nara then turned around. ‘I found him!’ he yelled down the hall and someone shouted an acknowledgement back. Seconds later Chouji appeared in the doorway too.

‘Are you okay Naruto?’ he asked with concern.

Naruto wiped the last of the dampness of his face and nodded vigorously.

‘Let’s hurry up and go, dattebayo!’ he exclaimed.

"was significant. He couldn’t keep this up, against the strange Mokuton wielding plant man of unknown origin. This wasn’t like anything he’d ever fought before, but Kakashi wasn’t an elite of the elite for nothing. Using his left hand to throw out an explosive note, he created some distance between himself and his opponent by going out of the door quickly and then whistled. Before the smoke cleared, his nin-dogs, minus Pakkun and Bull collected in front of him.

“Hold him down for me if you get a chance,” he panted and the pack barked back its’ agreement, launching into attack formation at once. Vines and smoke shot out of the suddenly breached wall, but his dogs dodged them, advancing on the creature. Kakashi took out a kunai with his working hand and channelled lighting chakra through it, before throwing it into the fray. He heard an impact and the vines fell limp onto the scorched and crumbling floor.

“Now!” he commanded his dogs and they gripped onto each of the plan-man’s limbs.

“Just one more...” Kakashi thought, gathering chakra in his left hand this time. His vision was beginning to go blurry, from the continued use of the Sharingan, lightning chakra and the Raikiri. He jumped forward, stabbing the creature once more. It finally stilled and crumpled to the floor lifelessly. The Copy Ninja let out a shaking breath and checked for a pulse. There was nothing, so he covered his Sharingan and turned away, to find his students as fast as possible. If only he had stayed, he would have seen the strange man split in two, the dead white half collapsing in on itself. The black half then devoured it, to every last hair, before beginning to rise up again. Another white creature appeared out of the wall, then another and another. One approached the black half and they merged together, their flesh fusing and transforming anew.

*

Naruto, Sakura and Sasuke were stopped in their tracks by three strange white creatures. Immediately getting in their fighting stances, the Genin were trying their best to keep calm in their first real fight. These were the enemies that had taken down a squad of Chuunin. Sakura’s knees were shaking, but she straightened up, a determined expression on her face.

The three white figures moved towards them, their movements fluid. Naruto breathed in, trying to steady himself, not to rush in, when Sasuke made the choice for him and shot forward, attacking the closest creature with several kunai, which it dodged and extended it’s arm, getting a hold of the Uchiha’s sleeve. Before Naruto could process what was happening, an exact copy of Sasuke stood before them and formed the handseals for Gokakyuu no Jutsu. The three Genin dodged frantically, barely escaping the blazing fireball.

“Don’t let them touch you,” Sasuke grunted, getting to his feet in a defensive stance in front of his cone.

“No shit,” Naruto snorted, jumping up like a spring, just out of the reach of another one of the strange white creatures. Beside him, Sakura almost got caught but managed to chop off her assailant’s arm with a decisive slash of her kunai. Panting heavily, she fell to the ground, her breath shaky and quick.

Naruto needed to create distance between himself and the strange creature, but the only jutsu that might have been useful there that he knew required a water source. If only he could conjure enough water from the air… but that wasn’t an option now. Instead, he tossed half of all the kunai he had in quick progression, just to keep the creatures away. Sasuke was engaged in a taijutsu battle with his doppelganger, not paying much attention to his teammates.

“L-looks like it has all the same abilities as Sasuke-kun!” Sakura exclaimed still somewhat shaken, but more attentive now. Kakashi’s hellish training had paid off after all.

“So… they copy you by touch? We can’t let them get to us. Sakura, do you know any jutsu?” Naruto tried to think frantically, but with the blood pumping loudly in his ears and trying to watch their enemies’ movements, he couldn’t quite concentrate. Calm down, he told himself, but it didn’t really work. Sakura threw a few of her own shuriken in, protecting Naruto just in time.

“We need to take down the Sasuke-clone! Then he can help us with the other two,” the blond said, back to back with Sakura now, both on the defensive. The white creatures were now recovering from their attack and were about to run towards them again.

“Kawarimi with Sasuke,” Sakura told him then, her eyes suddenly bright with determination.

“Are you out of your MIND? That’ll never work, 'tebayo!” Naruto panicked, pushing her sideways to avoid one of the creature’s arm that had shot towards them. “It’s really not that sort of jutsu!”

“Just DO It,” the girl commanded, throwing the rock she’",candidate00009
"had been so wrong.

Nothing in his mind fitted together anymore. The memories with jagged edges were slowly making a sharp crack in his new life, threatening to flood over and ruin everything. He had tried so hard to make Daphne’s dream marriage come true, but he did not know if he could do so any longer. Sleep sneaked up on him swiftly and he greeted it eagerly, wishing to just forget for a couple of hours. When he awoke again, he knew what he had to do.

Cooking had never been his forte, but he was a quick learner and the recipe was not that difficult. His hands appeared to remember it well enough, familiar with the motions he could not recall consciously. Extra cinnamon, he knew just how to make it. When Daphne arrived, the lovely scent had filled the house and was escaping out of the kitchen window. It smelled delicious, he thought with a smile on his face. It was perfect.

When Daphne returned, he was just cleaning up the flour off the counter.

“Emmanuel?” The name felt like a sharp blow, deflating his eagerness at once. “What are you cooking?”

Daphne entered the kitchen, her face scrunched up oddly. She seemed out of place, he thought, his mind reeling. This was not how it was supposed to be. It wasn’t right.

“Apple pie,” he announced with a smile sneaking onto his lips. “It’s your favourite.”

Daphne covered her mouth with her hand, eyes narrowing. He felt his heart drop heavy as lead.

“I hate apple pie. I hate anything with cinnamon in it.”

He took a step back, feeling so separated from her reality; it was like watching the actions unfold automatically on a film.

“No. You must.” He felt his throat constrict, suddenly dry. “I know the person I love likes apple pie. I love you, don’t I?”

The words felt so foreign on his tongue; toxic and twisting his insides uncomfortably. The deafening silence in the wake of Daphne’s lack of response was like a hurricane just waiting to strike. He felt so small, ready to crumble under the force of it. He looked to her for any support, but the kind, selfless woman who helped him out of the lake was gone, closed off behind a cold wall. He could see the thoughts swirling behind her eyes – the loss, the disappointment. He reached out for her uncertainly, but she was already running up the stairs, too distraught to face him.

He stood there in silence for what seemed like a small eternity, letting the lonely silence gently rip him apart.

 



❖

 After he finally regained some control of himself, wiping half-dried tears from his face, he’d slouched in the couch, comforted by the darkness of the living room and the scent of cinnamon and freshly baked pie. It felt a little like home.

When Daphne left for work the next morning, it came as a wave of relief to him. He did not know how to face her. She was not who he had thought she was. So many mistakes had been made, layered one on top of the other… there was no way of fixing it all so easily. He slipped the wedding band off his finger, placing it on the mantelpiece. It was meaningless. They never consummated the marriage and now, he was surer than ever that he did not want to. He had felt obliged to try, for Daphne… but it just brought pain to them both.

He could still hear Daphne walking down the steps outside, talking to someone. A man. There was an inexplicable surge of hope in him, like a great fire had been lit in the darkness of his soul. He rushed to the door, opening it just as the stranger was about to knock.

“Cas?”

The green-eyed man stared at him with wide eyes. As if he’d seen a ghost.

The stranger was taller than him, dressed in loose jeans and a black jacket. His skin was healthily tan, as on someone who spent a lot of time outside. He had a bit of stubble, short hair… and was now on the verge of tears, blinking them back quickly when his lips stretched, showing the most breathtaking smile he had ever seen. All words of denial escaped him at once and he could feel himself smiling back too.

“Cas.” The man hugged him with so much force he was almost knocked back. He threw both arms around him, squeezing tightly. “Oh, fuck, Cas, I knew you couldn’t be dead,” the man choked out the broken words into his shoulders, shuddering with deep breaths of relief.

He didn’t know what to do, under such an intense… attack. His whole body hummed with pleasure in the embrace, fitting right up against the stranger like it belonged there. This man knew him.

He felt heat rise low in his belly, uncoiling something long forgotten. He trembled, closing his eyes as the overwhelming emotions washed over his body.",candidate00009
"left. His vision is swimming and dark, just barely good enough to see the pale, weak Angel writhing in pain beneath him.

“Gabe,” he tries to say, but nothing comes out of his mouth and he feels like someone has gripped his voice box and yanked it right out of him. “Gabriel,” he manages to squeeze out after all, forcing himself. The former Trickster gropes around blindly for Sam’s hand, seeking reassurance.

“Hey Sasquatch,” he grinds out somewhere between the gurgling of blood in his throat.

Sam wants to take Gabe and run, to save them even at the cost of the world burning up in Lucifer’s misguided wrath, but it’s too late – the fallen angel is already so close, wielding a sword of flame and darkness. He’s ready to make his move, but Sam has no intention of going with his plan. There would be no final, massive showdown. He just wants to save Gabriel.

“Oh, brother.” Lucifer’s mouth twists up in a wicked attempt at a smile. “Not you too,” he practically whines, dropping his arms down in mock defeat. “Another one gone over a human,” he shakes his head in disappointed. “Did the burning of infant Nephilim teach you nothing?”

“Fuck you,” Sam spits out, looking him directly in the eyes. He may be the fucking Devil, but he’s standing between a Winchester and his Angel, which you should never ever want to do.  

“Sam,” Gabriel calls hoarsely, his fists balled in the younger Hunter’s jacket. “Don’t.”

He’s practically begging.

“You should listen to him, you know,” Lucifer giggles gleefully. “You don’t stand the ghost of a chance.” He’s entirely too pleased with his own joke for Sam’s liking and he’s ready to punch the bastard if he has to resort to that.

But Gabriel’s hand tightens around his wrist and he feels a tug on it. It’s the sign they’ve used before, a signal for Sam to close his eyes – usually in a much safer and intimate situation, but he obeys anyway. He doesn’t even think about it, he just does it. He trusts Gabriel, though he’s worried. Whatever the Angel is going to do, Sam doesn’t like the possibility of.

“Hey Sam,” Gabriel’s hand is on his cheek; trembling. Sam blindly puts his own over it, feeling the fading warmth of his Angel’s body. He chokes back unintelligible words which are bubbling up in his chest.

“I think I might be falling for you.” Sam feels, rather than seeing, the wide grin on the former Trickster’s face. He can’t stop his closed eyes  from watering. Lucifer, surprisingly, doesn’t mock him for crying at the scene of the final battle, in fact he’s silently watching them. Uncomprehending.

“Gabe, I-,” Sam starts, but then he feels the last of the warmth in his Angel’s hands seep away and he’s thrown backwards. Even his firmly closed eyelids flash with brightness and he thinks he can hear Lucifer scream. Or maybe it’s him, still pulling at the empty space where Gabriel had been merely a fraction of a second before.

When he finally opens his eyes, he notices he’s in a giant, smoking crater. Lucifer is not far off, swaying on his feet. He might be saying something in a language Sam has never heard of, but doesn’t care to learn of at the moment, because he’d rather chop off the Devil’s head with one clean sweep of his own sword. Which is exactly what he does, pushing all his frustration, confusion and anger into one thrust. He doesn’t hesitate and suddenly, it’s over.

He’s just barely holding himself together; his whole body is wrecked by deep, sharp sobs and he just can’t stop the tears from flowing now. He’s somehow survived the blast of Grace which burned the ground for miles around, but Gabriel – his Angel, his everything, has vanished from existence without a trace. The Archangel had sacrificed himself for them again.

❖

Three months after the defeat of Lucifer, Sam still misses Gabe so much he’s ready to rip his own heart out and join him in Heaven, despite how strongly he hates almost everybody else up there. He won’t though, because deep down, he knows they will meet again. Yeah, Gabriel had a little red on his ledger and some bad history with the big guys back in Heaven, but he was an Archangel who had prevented the Apocalypse. There was no way they wouldn’t let him in. Or so he reasons with himself, against everything the Universe keeps throwing at him. As long as there is that little sliver of hope that the former Trickster’s Grace survived and made it back, that one day he’d find Gabriel waiting",candidate00009
"“I wonder if Kuromaru is actually a boy or a girl,” Ikkuu says thoughtfully, making Kirie scowl.

“Does it matter?” she folds her arms across her chest.

“Not really.”

“Then why’d you bring it up!” Kirie is annoyed, as she always is these days. Touta Konoe is a strange existence indeed, stirring the whole Holder into complete disarray with his mere presence.

“Want to go see how their training is going?” he smiles and the scowl she sends his way would be enough to make any other man back off, but he’s pretty used to it by now.

“I don’t care how that… incompetent is doing,” she turns her nose up. “Besides, it’ll probably be dangerous. I don’t feel like dying today.”

“Hai, hai,” he says lightly and returns to the book he’s been reading. After a few minutes of silence, he can literally feel Kirie vibrating with annoyance without even looking in her direction. Teasing her never gets boring.

“I’m going for a walk!” she gets up and stops off, not for a second fooling him. She’s going to spy on Touta and Kuromaru, it’s been her favourite pastime as of late. He follows her a moment later.

They’re in their usual training spot, behind the hot springs where it’s usually safe enough to go all out without hurting anyone or destroying too much. No one wants to get on Makabe-senpai’s bad side after all. The two youngest immortals in their ranks are fighting with enthusiasm, though a brawl with their bare fists might be a better description of this ‘training’. They’re practically rolling around in the dirt, but there are smiles on both their faces.

“What are you doing here,” Kirie hisses at him from her hiding spot. They haven’t noticed him yet and she drags him into the bushes with a surprising amount of strength. His mechanic body isn’t exactly light.

“I’m sure they’d let you watch or join in if you asked,” Ikkuu says, making himself comfortable. Kirie goes red on the face.

“S-shut up, it’s not like that.”

“Hm.”

Kirie punches him, but quickly withdraws her hand, wincing in pain. “Idiot cyborg,” she complains.

“Is that all you’ve got, Kuromaru?!” Touta shouts and all of a sudden he’s kicking up a sandstorm, using shunpo as a makeshift attack. The ex-immortal hunter produces a sword from nowhere and slices through the incoming hail of sand and stones with ease.

“Looks like they’re getting serious,” Ikkuu smiles. His sensors are picking up a rush of ki being released. Beside him, Kirie’s face lights up in excitement; only because she doesn’t know he’s watching.

Then something obviously goes wrong, because there’s an explosion and before he can really process what is happening, he finds himself curled over Kirie, defensive shield activating just before the visual feed from his eyes cuts out and his internal systems shut down.

When his backup power activates seconds later, he’s being rushed back to the mansion. Touta and Kuromaru are carrying him, both covered head to toe in dirt, blood and oil. The sound is cutting out, some of the microphones in his ears must be damaged. Kirie is saying something frantically, her face pale. She’s holding what appears to be his detached arm, wires torn and tangled.

“I … save point … stupid,” she’s obviously angry but marches on beside him. Then she visibly sighs, her face relaxing a little. She leads them to one of his usual mechanics, where Touta unceremoniously dumps his broken body. His vocal output isn’t working either, so he sits there quietly while he’s being slowly put together. Kirie seems to have calmed down. She’s glancing at him every other minute, alternatively worried and annoyed. It’d be almost cute, if he wasn’t certain she’d kill him and bring him back to life just to show him how stupid he’s being.

When he’s finally restored to somewhat working condition, it’s quite late and she’s fallen asleep leaning against one of the assembly machines. She’s grabbing onto his hand in a way that isn’t at all romantic, it would probably be rather painful if he was able to feel it.

“Just in case I need to reset,” she mumbles in her sleep.

"pedal. He was going to go straight home and take a bath - that would soothe his aching muscles.

It was getting dark and somewhat chilly. He should have brought a jacket, he concluded. His freely wandering thoughts were interrupted by an unusual sight in the distance.

Something was approaching from the opposite direction and he had to squint to see in the shadowed figure struggling uphill. It was a familiar mess of green hair. Makishima…?

He was climbing.

Swaying from side to side dangerously, Makishima danced gracefully. The closer they got to each other, the clearer it became that the green haired boy was exhausted. His hands were clutching the handlebars desperately and his face was drenched with sweat. He didn’t seem to recognize Tadokoro, completely focused on his lone struggle against the hellish hill towards the school.

‘Makishima!’ he called out. ‘Makishima!’

His friend just kept going, but his pace slowed considerably. He was crawling upwards, his legs practically groaning under the strain. He passed Tadokoro, but it was doubtful he could make it all the way to the top in this state.

‘Makishima!’ he called out again, this time turning around to catch up with him. The green head turned slowly towards him.

‘Tadokoro?’ he ground out, his breath ragged and hoarse. ‘What are you doing here…?’

‘I should be asking you that. What are you thinking, pushing yourself so hard right after practice? You look like shit.’

They came to a stop and Makishima wobbled feebly on the spot. He was completely exhausted.

‘I have to perfect this,’ his grip on the handlebars tightened. ‘There’s not enough time…’

‘Wearing yourself out isn’t going to miraculously achieve anything overnight,’ Tadokoro said firmly, placing a hand on his friend’s bony shoulder. ‘Have you even eaten?’

Makishima blinked stupidly at him. Obviously he hadn’t.

‘We’re going for food then you’re going home to rest, alright?’ Tadokoro wasn’t going to take a no for an answer. Makishima looked like he wanted to argue, but lacked the energy to do so. He seemed to visibly deflate even as they rode downhill.

Tadokoro didn’t know what to say. He knew that everyone on the team worked harder than ever now, trying to bring their own abilities to a higher level. But exhausting yourself to the point of injury would only be counterproductive. If Makishima couldn’t ride with them…

‘You’re making a scary face, Tadokoro,’ his friend laughed weakly. ‘What’s up?’

Tadokoro shrugged. An awkward silence seemed to hang between them all the way until they settled in at the nearest family restaurant. The menu wasn’t the most impressive, so he decided to just order everything.

Makishima stared, bewildered as plates piled in front of him. He only managed a salad in the same time as Tadokoro had already inhaled chicken nuggets, a wrap, fries, beans, a tub of ice cream and several other items.

‘You going to finish that?’ he asked Makishima, pointing vaguely at the burger from the set he’d ordered. Makishima handed the plate over mutely.

After a moment he said, ‘How do you manage to eat so much?’ and scrunched up his nose, confused. It was quite a cute look.

‘It’s good. And I burn off all unnecessary calories in practice. If my body mass changed suddenly, I’d lose the strength I use for sprinting.. so I need to balance exercise and the food I eat throughout the day.’ It wasn’t the first time he’d had to explain his eating habits to curious people. Everyone wanted him to diet and lose weight, but his body mass was not only something he worked hard to maintain, it was his unique weapon in road racing. ‘You need a tough body to match your resolve to win.’

‘That’s unexpectedly thoughtful,’ Makishima laughed. He helped himself to a few more fries.

‘I guess I was a bit impatient… Toudou’s been egging me on,’ he showed Tadokoro his phone, flooded with text messages from the other climber. There were a lot of emojis and most of it made virtually no sense. He couldn’t help but burst out laughing. Makishima eventually caved in and began laughing too, holding his sides.

‘Feel better?’ Tadokoro asked after they quieted down again.

‘Yeah,’ Makishima smiled widely. It was a rare sight and something in Tadokoro’s stomach began to feel ticklish and restless. It probably wasn’t because of all the food. ‘Thanks, man.’

Yuusuke got up to leave and Tadokoro glared at him reproachfully.

‘What..?’ the green haired boy swallowed thickly, apprehensive.

‘Take care of yourself. It’s important for the team,’ Tadokoro got up too and punched Makishima on the arm, grinning. ‘We’ll be counting on you!’

Yuusuke nodded, while patting his arm absentmindedly, not really bothered that it would probably form a bruise later.

"Japan, had requested all new models from her show in LA, thus most had to be flown in from other areas, like your sister.

            You ignored the man who stood in front of the group of models and parents explaining how the process would work. Yawning, you stood, muttered ""Bathroom,"" and crept to the exit.

            The heat of the hallway hit you with a hammer; your only relief was the small fan blowing in the doorway. It ruffled your hair and kept you just cool enough not to sweat as you decided on where you were going to go.

            The studio as a whole was very run down considering the caliber of designer and models. No air conditioning except in the room you'd just fled. Looking around, you caught sight of a ginger head of hair crossing the end of the hallway. Curious, and without any better plans, you decided to investigate. Maybe it was the guy from the pool; you hadn't really had a chance to thank him properly for pulling you out. You followed him to an office and felt the cool air flowing out the doorway. You leaned on the open doorframe, reveling in the breeze.

            He turned and caught sight of you in the doorway, a pile of papers in his arms. ""Hai?""

            ""Er... Hi?"" you replied, mistaking the question for a greeting. You gave a small smile and wave.

            He gave you a somewhat put out look. ""No. Hai. It means 'yes' in Japanese. Can I help you?""

            ""Oh... um... I was just admiring the AC,"" you admitted shyly.

            ""AC?""

            ""Air conditioning. It's hot in the hallway.""

            He nodded and went back to fussing with papers. You looked around at the messy office strewn with sketches, notebooks, magazines, and all number of various writing utensils. ""Would you like some help?""

            The boy looked at the mess, then at you, and back at the mess. He shrugged. ""Sure.""

            ""Just tell me where to put things.""

            After a few minutes of silence, you glanced over at the boy. ""I'm (Name) by the way.""

            ""Hikaru,"" he replied with a smile.

            ""So... Japan, huh? Are you related to the designer?"" you asked, putting pens back into a cup on the corner of the desk.

            ""She is my mother.""

            ""So... how do you like the US so far, Hikaru?""

            He shrugged noncommittally and continued with the papers. You lapsed into silence as well, unsure what other questions to ask.

            ""Hey! Models are supposed to be in the dressing rooms getting fitted!"" a man with a clipboard and faint accent called to you from the doorway. He motioned for you to come with him. Ignoring the man, you continued to pick up pens and colored pencils. You wondered absently about how many writing utensils one person could have.

            ""Hitachiin-san..."" the man spoke before lapsing into a string of foreign words.

            Hikaru looked up at you curiously, ""Are you one of mother's models?""

            ""No.""

            He turned back to the man and replied in Japanese. The man left and Hikaru looked at you again. ""If you are not a model, what are you doing here?""

            ""My sister, the girl that tried to drown me, is a model. I got to come along for the ride."" You sighed as the last pen displaced a flyer that fluttered to the ground. Hikaru bent over and picked it up.

            ""Fireworks?"" he asked.

            Mentally counting days, you couldn't believe the timing of the model fitting. You nodded. ""I can't believe it's the fourth already...""

            Hikaru regarded the flyer quietly for a moment before asking, ""Is the fourth special?""

            ""Yes! It's Independence Day!""

            ""That's a big day, right?""

            You grinned. ""Of course, it's America's birthday! Fireworks are an American tradition. You should go!""

            He cocked his head to one side, meeting your gaze with his. ""Really?""

            ""Yeah! You're in America; it would be wrong not to go."" You took the flyer from him and read it. ""Tell you what. I'll take you as a thank you for pulling me out of the pool."" You grinned at him.

 

Hikaru was a tad bit surprised. He was so bored and here you were offering to take him to see some fireworks. A night away from the hotel would be nice, and his mother would be busy with designs basically all night. You weren't a model, either, so there was little chance you were trying to garner favor with the designer's son. Putting on his best host club smile, he replied, ""I would love to.""

 

The change in Hikaru's demeanor from friendly to charming caught you off guard. ""Hotel lobby at six?"" he asked.

            All you could do was smile and nod.

            ""See you there,"" he said, turning and exiting",candidate00010
"drop from his face and regarded his brown eyes carefully. Usually there would be a hint of a joke by this point, if he were joking.


He shrugged. ""I'll have some wicked scars once it's healed. Besides, that's our lives, right? Honestly, I worry more about you when you walk home.""


You grinned and shook your head. Jax was probably your favorite member of the Seven, because he was a total sweetheart, despite your shared (illegal) occupation. ""I wonder what you're doing in the pits if you worry about a girl walking home alone at night.""


""I can't have a chivalrous streak?"" he teased.


""Have you seen our line of work?"" you replied incredulously.


""So? A pretty lady should always have an escort,"" Jax said with a wink and a hugely flirtatious grin. You smacked his arm lightly.


""It's a wonder you survive here."" There was a cry from down one of the dark hallways and then the roar of the crowd. ""Speaking of which… shouldn't you be working?""


Jax gave an over dramatic sigh and scratched at the bandage on his cheek. ""You obviously wouldn't know since you don't normally come Thursdays, but I'm the host tonight.""


You groaned. That was your least favorite thing to do: greet everyone who enters and direct them down one of three hallways: to drugs, to sex, or to battles. ""I'm so sorry.""


""No, no, it's alright,"" Jax said airily. ""Where to?"" he asked, bowing dramatically. ""Battles, battles, or battles?""


Giving a snort of laughter, you crossed your arms. ""I thought there were other choices?"" you asked playfully.


Jax looked at you and grinned wide, exposing his perfectly white teeth. ""Are you suggesting we get a room?""


Bubba, who had been silent through the exchange, kicked Jax hard in the shin.


""Ouch! Cool it, little guy. I'm teasing her.""


Bubba growled all the same, and you thought it better to continue on your way into the battling portion of the warehouse, which was by far the largest section.


As you walked down the hallway, the chatter of the crowd grew louder. There were more cheers and you heard a trainer's whistle blow. The trainer was booed away as you came to the closed door. Sighing, you recalled Bubba to his pokéball before pushing the heavy metal door to the side.

Okay, so... no Volkner this chapter. I'm sorry! But hopefully the Pits intrigue you enough to continue reading~ :3 Which brings me to the next point... the Pits are a bit complex. So it'll take a couple chapters to explain them. This one should clarify quite a bit!

Thank you dark_wing19 for being my beta, again! So without further delay, here's chapter two!

The smells of sweat, blood, and cigarette smoke assailed your nose as the door swung wide. The cacophony of voices, cheers, and jeers doubled in volume as you entered the adjoining warehouse. Your shoes clicked on the sheet metal platform as you shouldered your way through the crowded walkways. You'd always entered from the back entrance when you were working, so the throng of people was an obstacle you'd never faced before. Shoved to the center of the platform by the crowd, you quickly realized that it was less dense than the edges.


Of course, this made perfect sense to you with the way the room was set up. ""The Pits"" was a very literal name for this warehouse. The elevated sheet metal platform had nine battling arenas at ground level, six feet below the platform. These formed a three by three grid, separated by the eight foot wide steel railed walkways.


The only difficulty in walking towards the center of the pathways was that for maneuverability, you sacrificed the ability to actually see who occupied each pit. From prior knowledge, you knew that the four corner pits and the center one housed members of the Seven. However, which member was in which pit was anyone's guess. Nobody ever had the same pit two nights in a row, and half the time there was no set pattern to the rotation.


You squeezed your way to the front railing of the corner pit you were nearest to. Disappointment fluttered in your stomach as you saw that two girls occupied this pit: a woman in her mid twenties by the name of Janine (a member of the Seven), and her challenger.


Stuck against the rails now that you'd wormed your way to the front, you watched as Janine's mightyena sprinted at the opposition. The little rattata squeaked in terror and tried to flee, but was caught in powerful jaws.


""Finish it with a crunch!"" Janine commanded. The large black dog pokémon crunched down hard. The rattata let out a high pitched cry of pain and went limp. The trainer blew her forfeit whistle, but the mightyena ignored it. Blood dripped from its mouth as",candidate00010
"do it for her, but either way, the effect was enchanting. Kyouya felt the slight longing in his heart, while he knew Tamaki was quite possibly shattered. They'd all had a thing for Haruhi at one point, but there was one of her and six of them. She'd made her choice and it did no good dwelling on it.

            Tamaki collected himself rather well before gliding over to greet them. He gave Haruhi an overenthusiastic hug and shook Hikaru's hand vigorously before also giving him a hug. Once he'd said hello, the couple moved away from the door and Tamaki greeted the next couple with just as much gusto.

            Kyouya was able to pick out the red head, and his heart sank slightly. She would be with him. And sure enough, as Tamaki moved you came into view on the arm of Kaoru, looking more beautiful than ever. He wondered who had designed your dress, you or Kaoru, as you walked away.

            There were reasons he'd stopped keeping in touch with that member of the host club. While he tried to convince himself it was because someone in fashion could never be of use to him, he knew it was partly because Kaoru had stolen you away. He noted no engagement ring on your finger as you laughed at something Tamaki said before the blond kissed both of your cheeks in farewell and scurried off to socialize with other people.

            The angry, possessive beast Kyouya had thought he'd quashed reared it's ugly head as he followed your movements with his eyes. It urged him to take you back first chance he got. You'd been his light that last year of high school, and he wanted it back.

 


            ""Her mother is that famous American lawyer and her father is a very accomplished brain surgeon here in Japan. I want you to become friends with her so that, should I need a favor from her father, you can help me to get it,"" his father told him, handing over a slim manila envelope.



            Kyouya opened it and studied the file. You were two years his junior, having just moved up to the senior high school wing when school started in the fall. He shut it and nodded to his father with determination.



            ""It's done.""


 

            By the time you were finally alone, Kyouya had been rooted to the same spot for a good hour. He'd talked briefly to a couple people, but otherwise he'd just watched as you clung to Kaoru while he socialized. Being two years younger, you didn't know many of the people there, except for members of the host club. Even though Mori and Hunni had graduated before you'd entered high school, you'd met them during your time with Kyouya, and it was talking to them that had ultimately left you alone.

            ""____,"" Kyouya said as he approached. You bristled at the sound of his voice and turned to look at him, plastering a fake smile on your face.

            ""Kyouya. It's nice to see you well,"" you replied, frantically scanning the room for somebody to come to your rescue.


 



            ""I'm Ohtori Kyouya. It's a pleasure to meet you,"" he said, giving his warmest smile and extending a hand to you. Your face turned pink as you shook his hand and nervously gave him your name.



            ""That's a beautiful name. Are you lost?"" Kyouya's luck was with him; you'd walked into a Host Club meeting the day after his father had given him the assignment.



            ""V-very. I was looking for the library.""



            ""Let me show you where it is,"" he replied, offering his arm to you. You took it and followed him. Kyouya's act was working like a charm as he led you to the library and told you if you needed anything to just ask.



 


            ""How is school?"" he asked, trying desperately to make conversation.

            ""It's good. After Tamaki went to France to finish his degree and you guys all moved back to Japan, Kaoru moved up to New York. He contacted me about a summer internship for Yuzuha, his mother. After that, she'd paid for my schooling.""

            Kyouya nodded.

            ""It must have been a dark time, three years ago. Kaoru told me that Tamaki's grandmother made him return to France, and once he'd left, Haruhi chose Hikaru and the rest of you slowly came back to Japan.""

            The man nodded again, preferring to forget how their joint excursion to America to follow Haruhi had fallen to pieces. After graduating in May, Haruhi and Hikaru had been married and returned to Japan. Only further proving that it had been a disastrous idea to begin with. Getting back into his father's good graces had been one of the most difficult things Kyouya had ever done.

            ""So, how are you?""


 



            ""How are you,"" you paused and flushed before looking up at him and grinning, ""Kyouya-kun?""



            ""I could not be more fantastic,"" Kyouya replied, smiling warmly at you.",candidate00010
"hairdryer currently turned on high.
           

""There you are, ma'am.""
          

  After getting the old woman all squared away, Haruka turned and smiled at the man. ""Do you need me to touch up your roots, sir?""
           

He nodded stiffly, again, and followed Haruka over to the chair the old woman had vacated. ""Do you need a trim as well, or just the roots bleached?""
           

""Just the bleach.""
           

""If you could follow me over here..."" Haruka pointed to the sinks.
           

After adjusting the seat so her client was comfortable, she started rinsing his hair. As she ran her fingers through it, she noticed how damaged and melted it truly was. ""Who was the last person to do your hair?""
           

 He shrugged noncommittally, trying to ignore her as best he could and just get the stupid thing over with. Sometimes bleaching his hair was such a pain in the ass.
           

""Okay... um. I'm Watanabe Haruka. And you are?""
           

""Heiwajima Shizuo.""
           

Haruka nodded and gave a small smile. At least it was some sort of response. Having only lived in Ikebukuro since the school year started, she was ignorant to the whispers surrounding her current client.
           

 ""And, if you don't mind my asking, where do you work, Heiwajima-san?""
           

 Silence. They walked back over to her chair, and Shizuo sat down while Haruka went to get bleach.
           

The rest of the time was spent with Haruka probing as cautiously as possible for responses from her very antisocial client. While he found her infuriatingly annoying, Shizuo managed to keep his cool rather well, and was quite pleased with the end result. He ran a hand through his hair, noting that she'd put something in it to make it soft again, almost like his natural hair.
           

""And you should put this in your hair at least once a day to keep it soft, Heiwajima-san,"" Haruka told him, handing over a bright pink bottle. ""It works wonders on bleached hair. Oh! Let me wrap it up for you.""
           

Shizuo exited the salon with a small, brown package, and an only slightly put out expression on his face.
           

""Nothing was broken!"" one of the other hair stylists exclaimed, coming out of the break room. ""Amazing! How did you do it?""
           

 ""What do you mean?"" Haruka asked as she washed off the brush.
           

 ""Every time that Heiwajima Shizuo comes into the salon, whoever does his hair is fired and something is smashed!""
 



*

When Haruka got home, Rikiya was waiting with two small clay pots, potting soil, and two small day lilies. He grinned at her. ""Want to help me plant them, Haruka-neesan?""
           

 ""Sure,"" she replied, setting down her purse.
           

Her brother's lip had swollen considerably, but his nose had stopped bleeding. ""You really shouldn't be getting into fights like that, Ki-chan.""
           

""Why? I want to get stronger and protect you!""
           

""Fighting high schoolers won't make you stronger. Now come here."" She caught her little brother up in a hug before there was a knock at the door.
           

 ""I'll get it. You keep planting."" Haruka smiled and went to the door. Standing outside were two men. One had glasses and dreadlocks, and wore a black suit. The other, standing taller, hair newly bleached, in the same bartender outfit, was Heiwajima Shizuo.
           

 ""Tom-chan, how can I help you?"" Haruka asked innocently. She was not surprised to see the shorter man. He'd called and told her to expect a visit, but her newest client was a bit of a shocker. Of course, she shouldn't have been surprised that Tom had a bodyguard, considering his line of work.
           

""Have you gotten any of the money?"" he asked almost reluctantly.
           

 ""Some. Would you like to come in while I go get it?"" Haruka opened the door and ushered them inside before going to her purse.
           

 ""Who's at the door, Haruka-neesan?"" Rikiya asked.
           

""Tom-chan. Why don't you go find a place to put the lilies and water them, Ki-chan?"" Haruka ushered her brother into the next room with one clay pot in hand. She grabbed her purse, counted out all of her tips and returned to the two men waiting in the entryway.
           

""This is all I have for now. I'm sorry it's not even close to all of it."" She handed over the small stack of bills and smiled tentatively.
           

""It's fine. As long as you're paying.""
           

""I still can't thank you enough for lending me the money to get this apartment back. It means a lot.""
           

""I've put the pots away, Haruka-nee~!"" Rikiya sang happily. ""Does Tanaka-san want to stay for dinner?"" The little boy had taken a shine to the loan shark, as he came over every other week to collect payments. The boy was oblivious",candidate00010
".

You still didn't have an answer when there were no more pairs of lines in her lips, and so you returned your attention to the book. You slowly turned the pages until you were on the first chapter. You read the first page with painstaking attention to detail, reading every line, word, and character, trying with all of your might to determine whether this combination of words meant anything to you. If Cathy was asking, it was important.

Nothing about that first page held anything familiar to you. You closed the book and turned it over. Unlike the front cover, the back was black with a couple of lines of white lettering. There were no pictures behind the words, and no reviews of praise from critics above or below the block of text. Just the short summary and the barcode. You read the summary, hoping that it would jog your memory.


When a selkie's pelt is stolen, it's up to her girlfriend to find the culprit. But as the days pass, the selkie slowly begins to slip into madness. With no leads of the thief or the location of the pelt, she must decide whether to stay with the selkie or leave for a new life. As a human, she doesn't understand the gravity of the situation. Will her love prevail over the encroaching madness? Or will she give up and move on?


Deep down, you felt as though you knew this story, but you still didn't know if you'd read the book. It didn't look familiar to you. Cathy's intense gaze felt like it was boring holes into your forehead as you stared at the back cover. You counted the lines in the barcode. And then you counted how many different thicknesses of bars there were. And then you counted how many bars were of each thickness, all the while stalling against Cathy's stare. You wanted to give her the answer she wanted to hear.

""I don't think I have,"" you said after counting all of the characters in the summary, first without spaces or punctuation, then without spaces, then including spaces.

Cathy sighed and stood up.

You panicked. Cathy never had a visit this short. You had to keep her here, you weren't ready for her to leave.

""Is it a good book?"" you asked.

""You should read it."" Cathy picked up her purse and slung it over one shoulder. It was a purse that you had gotten her many years ago. The faux leather was beginning to crack, revealing white below the burgundy exterior. The straps had many lines of stitching from repairs over the years. It was the last Christmas present that you had given to her before everything changed.

""Are you leaving?"" you asked, moving your gaze from the old purse to catch her eye.

""I am. I'll be back tomorrow, okay?"" She bent down and kissed you softly on the lips before leaving the room. The heavy metal door swung shut behind her. You heard the lock grind shut from the outside as the metal mechanisms scraped against one another. Cathy's face appeared briefly behind the diamond mesh encased in glass that made up your only window, and then she was gone. When she left, so did your humanity. She was the only thing still grounding you in this world. You screamed and threw the book at the door before dropping to all fours and crawling in circles on the floor. There had to be a way out on one of the walls. If you just kept circling, kept looking, you would find it. And then you could go back to your life with Cathy. You had to find it. If you just kept circling, it would show up eventually.

 

Cathy clenched her skirt in her hands when you began screaming. As she walked away from your room escorted by a guard, she had to try to block you out. You always screamed and threw the book at the door when she left. Your mind only seemed present when she sat across from you. And even then, you weren't who you used to be. The guard put a comforting hand on her shoulder and squeezed lightly. He was trying to convey his sympathies, Cathy supposed, but it wouldn't work. Your craziness wasn't your fault; it hadn't been bad genetics or drugs. It had been someone else. Someone had taken a piece of your soul and run away with it.

""How was she today?"" the receptionist asked conversationally when Cathy returned her visitor's badge.

""Same as always.""

""Have there been any leads on her pelt?""

Cathy shook her head.

""That's a shame.""

""The selkie leaders aren't convinced that she'll return to normal anymore. It's been too long.""

""Are you giving up on her?""

Cathy shrugged. She asked herself that question every day. Did she give up on you? Did she move on with her life and leave you to rot in here? Or did she keep trying to break through the",candidate00010
".

            ""Santa!"" you whispered excitedly.

            The man's eyes snapped to you. It had been completely quiet, and your voice carried.

            ""Who is there?"" he asked with a heavy accent.

            ""Me!"" you crawled out from under the tree, your big dog following you.

            ""(Name)?"" he asked, and laughed heartily. ""Very clever. Now to bed.""

            ""But Santa..."" you whined, ""I want you to give this to Jack!"" you held up a lumpy, poorly wrapped package. You had done your best considering you'd done it in secret.

            ""Jack?""

            ""Jack Frost! He knows you!"" you said.

            ""Jack Frost?"" he chuckled. ""The Jack Frost?""

            ""Yeah!"" you grinned.

            ""He said he was going to be at the North Pole today! Can you give this to him?""

            ""North Pole?"" Santa asked. He added something under his breath. He took the gift. ""I will give it to Jack,"" he told you. ""Now, to bed!"" He ushered you from the room before leaving presents and going up the chimney once more.

 

            A tap on your window two days later woke you early in the morning. Jack, gray eyes, disheveled white hair, and all, was crouched on the roof smiling though your window at you. The green scarf that you'd made for him wrapped tightly around his neck.

            You got up, waking Rex from his sleep. The dog stayed on the foot of your bed as you opened the window and Jack hopped inside.

            ""I love it!"" he told you, grinning.

            ""Really?"" you asked.

            ""Yes! It's wonderful!"" he told you, crouching down to be level with you. Proudly, you noted that he didn't crouch nearly so much as he had when you'd first met. You were getting taller!

            ""And I wanted to give you a Christmas present, too.""

            ""Really?""

            Jack nodded, held his hand up to his mouth and blew. An ice rose formed in his hand, and he handed it to you. ""Merry Christmas (Name)!""

            You looked at it in wonder, turning the frozen thing in your hands. It was already melting, but it was still beautiful.

            ""Now, what are we going to play today?"" he asked, grinning.

Baking Goodies - 13 years old

            Your mom was letting you make the sugar cookies this year. You felt so proud of yourself. You were finally old enough to be trusted in the kitchen. It was about time. You were thirteen after all. You were a teenager now! Not a baby.

            ""I need three batches, sweetheart,"" your mom said, kissing your forehead.

            ""Mom!""

            ""I can't kiss my baby?"" she asked.

            ""I'm not a baby!"" you protested, crossing your arms and frowning at her.

            She only smiled knowingly.

            ""Alright. Well, I'll be back after I run some errands. You and I can frost them if you're not done.""

            You ignored her in favor of pulling out ingredients. As you worked, you noticed that the kitchen window over the sink was frosted over. You could see the hand as it drew a picture of two stick figures flying over trees. Afterwards, it wrote a question mark. Snowy hair, gray eyes, and then that grin that meant trouble appeared in the window, along with the long crooked stick.

            Shaking your head, you went over and opened the sliding glass door.

            ""Why not?!""

            ""I'm making cookies!""

            Jack looked into the kitchen, which was a horrible mess. It looked like he'd already been in there; white powder covered almost every surface possible, including the thirteen year old in front of him. He wiped a smudge of flour off of your cheek and grinned.

            ""Can I help?""

            ""What do you know about baking, Jack?"" you asked in disbelief, putting your hands on your hips. If not for the flour, you would have been very sassy looking.

            ""I'll show you,"" he grinned and walked past you into the kitchen. He opened the fridge with his staff and balanced a carton of eggs on it and set it down on the counter. He then closed the fridge, cracked the eggs, and threw the eggshells at you before ducking.

            ""Hey!"" you squealed, running around the counter to try and catch the teenager of myth. He simply chuckled and jumped over the counter in one fluid motion, effectively evading you. However, the handful of flour you threw at him landed dead center on the front of his hoodie, making it look even more frosted than it already was.

            ""Oh, this means war,"" Jack said, making a snowball and chucking it at you. He missed, and the snow exploded against a cabinet door. You threw more flour at him as you ducked below the counter.

            This duck and throw game went one for an hour. When you were done, pools of water and flour littered the kitchen. Rex,",candidate00010
"there'd been the night he'd frozen the teddy bear to your window. He liked to check on your more and more often as you grew up. He wasn't sure why, but it didn't matter. He liked how human you were; you had a life, just like he wanted. Who wanted to be Jack Frost? All alone and forgotten.

""Hey! Who are you?"" you asked, glancing up from your history textbook, and noticing the teenager standing in your window. He wore a navy blue hoodie covered in frost and carried a staff much like a shepherd would have.

""Who? Me?"" he asked, pointing at himself.

""Is there anyone else out there?"" you asked. You knew you should have been more perturbed by this boy snooping around, but he seemed really familiar. Almost like an old friend. This was weird. You'd never seen him before. Of that, you were almost positive.

""Jack Frost,"" he told you. You rolled your eyes and went back to reading.

""Very funny. Which one sent you? Kaylee or Molly?"" Your friends hated your obsession with Jack Frost, and did everything in their power to make fun of you. Their newest stunt took dedication though. He was a very impressive looking young man; they probably paid him a lot to play the part.

""No seriously! I'm Jack Frost!"" the boy insisted. ""I can show you!""

""Alright. Show me,"" you replied, getting off your bed and walking over to the window. You crossed your arms and waited for something to happen.

The boy grinned at you and tapped his staff to the window. Frost curled out from the spot the staff touched. ""This is what I do every Christmas,"" he told you, grinning. He puffed up his chest with pride as you gaped at him.

""You… you're real!""

You'd been talking through the window, but you slid the window open to a blast of cold air. ""You're real!"" you said again. This couldn't be a joke; how would he know about the Christmas morning frost patterns? You'd told no one about those.

He chuckled happily and scratched the back of his head. ""Yup!""

""You don't understand. I have to tell everybody! You have to come with me! They'll believe me once they see you!"" you told him.

""Uh… That won't –"" Jack began, but you talked over him.

""Stay right there! I'll be right outside! Just, don't go away!""

Jack watched as you pulled on furry snow boots, grabbed your coat, and dashed out of your bedroom door. Seconds later, you came around the corner, panting from your sprint out of the house.

""Good! You're still here!"" you said, straightening.

Jack chuckled nervously. Now that somebody actually could see him, he wasn't sure what to do… his people skills were very rusty, he had only the kangaroo with over sized ears and the yeti minions of the big guy to interact with for the past three hundred years.

""Still here,"" he replied.

""You have to come with me to see my friends!"" you told him, grabbing his hand and pulling him towards the sidewalk in the front of your house. His hand was freezing in yours, but it wasn't surprising considering that he was in charge of winter.

Jack, however, was caught by surprise by how warm your hand was in his as you pulled him forward. He forgot for a moment that your friends wouldn't see him as he followed you around to the front of the house. When he collected his wits, he dug in his heels and staff, bringing you to a stop.

""What's wrong?"" you asked him, turning around to look at the young man.

""They won't see me.""

""What are you talking about? You're right here! Of course they'll see you!""

Jack shook his head and kicked at the ground. His shoulders slumped, and he wouldn't look at you. You dropped his hand.

""Why won't they see you?""

""Only people who believe in me can see me.""

""That's ridiculous!""

Jack tapped the long wooden staff against his shoulder a couple times before looking up at you. ""It's not. It's the truth. Until recently, you're the only one who believed in me.""

""How do you know that?"" you asked.

""I've… uh…"" Jack flushed, which surprised you considering how cold his hand had been. ""I've visited you more than a few times. After the teddy bear, I knew you must believe in me.""

""You've been… watching me?"" you asked, shivering.

""Oh no. Not like that!"" Jack said, taking a step forward and waving his hands in front of him.",candidate00010
