"fingers pluck unhurriedly at my tunic before sliding up underneath it. Palms warm against the small of my back as I swiftly undid my top, needing to feel his warm skin against mine. 

The feel of smooth skin rubbing against each other always felt delicious to me, even more so when a hot tongue slid past my lips and tangled with my own. I knew he wanted me, I could feel the proof against my stomach and my own was against his strong hip. We both moaned softly when I rubbed my hips against his in a slow roll. Of course I had a plan, I knew what I wanted and I was damn well going to get it!

I slowly ground my hips against his, swallowing his moans that fell between our slow kisses. Fingers trailed up my chest, making my skin prickle in slow waves before I tensed. No! Not my shirt! He couldn’t take it off! I grasped his wrist and babbled something about how it was erotic to do it partially dressed. It was true, but not the reason that I did not want to take my shirt off! Luckily he seemed more interested in continuing what we were doing then puzzling out my reaction and I found myself pressed down on my back on the bench, my lover looming over me. 

I smiled up at him, reaching up to trace my fingers along his face. I traced the arch of his nose, the slope of his brow and the curve of his lips. Alive, so wonderfully alive! Here with me and...oh...oohh I love how he teases my hands. His tongue traced between my fingers slowly as he held my wrist, flicking the tip against the webs between my digits. He smirked up at me when he had me panting, nipping the tip of a finger before he leant up to claim my lips again. 

I slid my free hand down his bared chest, meandering to hardened nipples to tease them gently just to hear his groans before continuing on my way to the hard shaft that bulged under his cloth. It didn’t take much before I had the front of his pant’s open and delved my hand into the heated dark V.

His shaft filled my palm as his moans floated about my ears. I felt my skin prickle with delight as my touch prompted him to start sucking on my fingers, eyes locked on mine the whole time. I murmured his name, a breathless smile of pleasure sliding across my face as he replied in kind though a tad muffled about my fingers. 

It wasn’t long before I pulled my fingers out of his mouth and replaced them with my tongue, wet fingers reaching into that dark V to spread his saliva about his flared head. Oh his low groan was music to my ears! My Tori is beautiful in his pleasure, arching towards my hands even as his own began to work on my belt. As it became looser about my waist, I had the sudden urge to mark him where everyone would see it and I found I did not care if the other knights saw it. I wanted them to see it and know that Astoria was claimed. Breaking from the hungry kiss, I avoided his attempt to draw me back in and instead moved to sink my teeth into his strong neck. Not enough to bleed, but enough to mark, to claim. I relished his bitten off shout and how his body jolted up against mine, heart pounding under my tongue. I leant back, licking his taste off my teeth as I admired the mark. Oh! It was beautiful! My love hovered above me, hair forming almost a curtain about us, blocking sight of everything but each other. He was half dressed, cloths falling off his firm frame and the mark of my teeth stood out in beautiful comparison to his tanned skin. 

He laughed then, a low sound from deep in his chest and I found myself pressing a hand to his pectorals to feel the sound against my palm. He asked me how he was supposed to hide that, being on the side of his neck as it were. “You do not” I replied and I think my possessive tone startled him. We had made no promises, no words of love or long time commitment but I am sure my tone indicated otherwise. I loved him, I knew I did though I do wonder if I would have realized just how much had I not lost him. I could feel the vial in my pocket, the vial I had been about to take to let my soul free and a spike of terror slid over me. Never again would I let myself fall so low and I vowed to never tell Astoria how close he came to losing me! One more day, nay, one more hour and it would have been too late. I disliked the feeling of being in some star-crossed lovers play and shoved it away ruthlessly. Tangling my fingers in his hair, I yanked him down to bite and suck at those beautiful pouty lips until he returned the favour and my possessiveness was forgotten for now. I would address it at a later date. 

At that moment, I was too busy kicking my loose",candidate00001
"getting drinks? That's what business men did after all. They spent a lot of money and showed clients a good time, at least in movies they did. Heading out, he spotted most of the group still at the stage but he did not spot the one he wanted. Turning slow circles, the voice right behind him nearly scared him into going ghost, he jumped so high.

 

“Looking for someone?”

 

He knew that voice, even without ever hearing it. He just knew it belonged to that older man, it FIT. Turning, Danny found himself flashing a slow grin, hands tucking into his back pockets in a way that he knew made the shirt ride up and felt gratified to watch those eyes flick down to the stretch of pale skin. It was just a split second, then they were back locked onto his but oh the flash of heat it caused was delicious.

 

“I might be.” he replied, aiming for coy but it came out just a bit breathy and licking his lips didn't help when the man watched his tongue like a hawk. How did you mention that you think someone stuffed too much money down your pants? Crap! He hadn't thought this far ahead! Panicking, he went with option two. “Care for a dance?” It wasn't the best offer and he struggled to hold back the wince though he was sure he failed by the slowly raised eyebrow it earned him. He wanted to kick himself, he was better then that! Not some brand new idiot that never touched a pole before! Opening his mouth to..do what? Apologize? Beat a hasty retreat? He wasn't sure before he was cut off.

“I want twenty minutes.”

 

Twenty? He could do that, hell yeah. Swallowing down the words he was about to say, he replaced them with. “This a gift or do I get you all to myself?” Much better! Mentally patting himself on the back with that recovery, he flashed a wide grin at the glint in the man's eyes. “Room five, you want a drink handsome?” Words he'd used before but he'd never meant them as much as he did right now. There was just something about that...flash of hunger in his eyes. Backed with that steel straight posture and general 'I'm above you attitude' that made Danny want to do two things. Mock his stupid shiny shoes and then suck his dick. It was a really fucking odd combination but the 'rum and coke' was easy enough to manage. He just hoped it wasn't about to be dumped on him. That had sucked last time. A lot.

 

Entering the room with the drink, he grinned slowly at the man sitting in the chair. The very handsome silver fox he wanted to climb like a tree. “Ohh I DO get you all to myself.” He said happily, sauntering in and offering the drink with a wink. “Lucky me.” Heading towards the small music player off to the side, he started to fiddle with it while swaying his hips. Taking a deep breath, he focused on the jingle of ice in the glass before getting up the nerve. “You're a generous man, not often I get tipped so well” he said, turning around to flash him a sweet smile as he music started and he sashayed towards him. “Especially not by someone like you.” Licking his lips, he stood with a leg on either side of his clients knees, hands sliding up his chest slowly. “Hands to yourself, keep them on the chair. You touch me, and it's over. Sorry, don't make the rules.” He wouldn't mind those hands over him. Ugh he needed to get laid if he was thinking like that so much. Especially about some business man who was probably married already. Well a boy could dream.

 

“Am I allowed to talk?”

 

Danny looked surprised at that before laughing, hands on his shoulders. “Oh please do.” He replied, humming under his breath as his palms slid down his chest. Silk top maybe? It felt really good under his fingers at any rate, good enough he almost missed his client's next words.

 

“Good, I have an offer for you.”

 

An offer? Oh of course, probably one of those 'I have a wife but' offers. Those were always entertaining though he'd never gotten one himself! Normally it was the girls that had men thinking they could just order up a night. “Lay it on me, I'm all yours. For the next twenty minutes at least.” He said with a chuckle, trying to cover up how breathless he felt. He wouldn't normally mention the time, it was sort of a no-no in the room but the glint his eyes had taken on 'all yours' had made his stomach swoop. Listening wouldn't hurt, right? Besides, he had the best fucking voice. What could go wrong with listening to it while rubbing up on him",candidate00001
", sweet and a little tart, a little sour but it makes you go back for more. I asked him then, when we broke apart for air why he never said anything and his answer both surprised and pleased me. He hadn’t wanted to be in the way. Thinking I truly wanted Anteares, he had kept quiet. Of course now assured that I no longer wanted to waste my time with the lippy loud-mouthed male, Astoria was all to happy to swoop in. 

When he pushed me down slowly onto my back on the bearskin rug, I didn’t complain. Anything but! I may have even wriggled a bit deeper into the lush fur, legs still around that trim waist. Astoria is bulkier then Antaeres. Muscles moved under his jacket and then my fingers were on them. I can’t remember who it was, but the jacket was gone, tossed to the side and my fingers were more then happy to explore. He was pale and the skin was almost smooth except for the scar on his left side. Along his ribs. I remember asking if someone had cut him as I traced it and getting a faint puff of laughter against my lips. It was cute, how ticklish he was but I left the spot alone as he kissed me again. He pushed my legs to the soft furs, remaining above me on all fours and asked me if I was sure. I think I might have lost a little bit of my heart then and there. Despite me teasing him, kissing him and greedily touching his bared skin, he still made sure I wanted him. I don’t think I answered him verbally. I believe I just shucked out of my leathers and pulled his chest to mine, demanding he touch me again. 

His hands were more callused as well and I liked them. They were strong broad hands, not afraid in their exploration but still gentle like he was afraid to hurt me. I think I startled him when I laughed and reached between his strong legs. Even through his pants I could feel his heat, his size made my body clench. I wanted him; I wanted his sweet smouldering heat and the way he looked at me like I was something precious. I rolled us over, straddling his waist and pressing my ass against his bulge. It felt delicious, especially when he arched up against me, voice deep with want. All for me. First I wanted to taste, I had tasted his kisses and I had to taste the rest of him. The pulse in his neck sped up when I ran my tongue down it, nipping at his collar bone. Oh! He was sweetly sensitive when my palms rubbed quick circles over his nipples, groaning my name. Cam, I love it when he calls me that. It sounds good coming from lips swollen with my biting kisses. I surged up to claim them again, moan being swallowed up as I was rolled under him again. It was his turn to explore and explore he did. 

His touches made me nearly dizzy with pleasure; he knew how to tease a man! Agile fingers teased down my sides as his tongue plunged into my mouth, teasing and scrapping everywhere they could reach. I cried out, uncaring of who heard me when those fingers left my sides and traveled to my hard aching nipples, swirling around teasingly before pinching sharply. He had my back bowing off the fur and against him effortlessly and only laughed when I cursed at him for it. I did not care but he seemed to and soon after that requested a room they were all too happy to give us. 

Once in the small room that I paid no attention to, I confess I nearly leapt on him, fingers going to his belt and yanking it open swiftly. I must have startled him because he barely made a move, hands going to my own that delved inside his opened pants before he was forced to grab at my shoulders. He was hot and heavy; I could feel his pulse against my fingers and had the urge to feel it against my tongue and swiftly dropped to my knees. His scent was heavy here, thick with musk and I inhaled deeply before dragging my tongue up from the base of that thick shaft. His gasping cry was so sweet to my ear that I moaned along with him as his taste burst on my tongue. Reaching the head, I wasted no time sucking the flared head into my mouth as my eyes fluttered shut. For long moments I sucked on him, tongue weaving inane patterns on his hard flesh, lips pulling and sucking as my fingers teased what wasn’t in my mouth. It was only when he grasped a handful of my hair and pulled me back, cock slipping free with a loud pop and a whine did I look up. Wild eyes stared down at me, the blue a darker color in his want. “You’ll make me cum.” That’s a sentence that will stay with me. Even now it makes my stomach clench in want. It was spoken so harshly, so desperately that when he pulled me up to take my mouth I let him, moaning and",candidate00001
"to feel Link inside of him anyways. Ever since the thought had occurred to him, his lower slit had been eager to be filled and throbbed at the thought of getting just that. Link looked just as eager, squirming to slide down and of course he would drag as much as of himself against Sidon’s cocks as possible just to hear him whine.

Being lifted up by a shuddering jerk of hips as if he weighed nothing was nice. Very nice. Link filed that away for later as Sidon scooted back till his back was propped up against a mound of pillows. Not quite sitting up but enough that he could see without craning his neck. Enough to reach down and show where his lower slit was already slick and slightly puffy. Enough to watch as Link rubbed his thumb over it a few times before bringing his thumb to his mouth to taste while shooting Sidon a knowing smirk. 

Kneeling between Sidon’s legs, Link was reminded sharply just how much bigger he was. It was thrilling, having all this strong, large, handsome Prince under him. Link was aware that he was short, even for a Hylian and Sidon? Sidon was big for a Zora, nearly twice his size and all spread out under him willingly. ‘Bet I can fit my whole hand in here’ He signed at the Prince, just to watch his slit clench as Sidon’s breath stuttered. “Link..” His voice was strained, a wheeze choked out through a harsh swallow. He liked this, this power over Sidon. 

With most of the heat gone, that left him with enough time to indulge himself. Bending down, he pressed soft sucking kisses against Sidon’s white stomach. Tongue leading the way down to twin dicks, two dicks, before he rubbed his cheek against one. Did all Zora have two? Or only some? Maybe only the royal line? Maybe only Sidon? He wasn’t sure but oh he was going to try and take them when they had to the time to prepare for it. Right now however, he was more interested in what lay below. 

Unoticable normally, the slit was puffy and slick now and felt so warm when he stroked his thumb around it without quite touching. Sidon’s hips shuddered and twitched as he tried not to move, to press against Link’s hand wantonly. This was for Link after all but oh! Oh he could not help the low hum of pleasure when Link pressed his palm over it and rubbed just enough to make him clench. That was nothing compared to the slick feel of a tongue giving a testing push before licking its way between sensitive folds. Sidon did not even bother to muffle his moans, thighs pressing against Link’s shoulders briefly before he made himself spread them again before he risked hurting him. He was so sensitive, how long had it been since anyone besides himself had touched there? He could not recall, a long time then. “Please...My dear Link, I cannot.!” he gasped, sharp teeth gritted slightly before he relaxed with a sigh when Link pulled back with a grin. ‘I’ll save the hand idea for later’ 

At first it was a matter of figuring out how to angle themselves, Sidon being so much bigger then Link. Eventually, they settled on Sidon mostly sitting up with Link kneeling between his legs to slowly press inside. This mean Sidon could wrap his arms and legs around him, clutching him close as Link rocked into delicious slickness. 

Babbling, he was babbling. A part of Sidon knew this but the rest was focused solely on how good it felt,  how perfect and right Link felt tucked up against him, surrounded by him. He could tell that Link was trying to keep a rhythm for him but would lose it sometimes, devolving into sharp little bucks before catching himself. Knowing he was doing that, causing Link to lose control was a heady thing. He wanted more. “Darling...my sweet perfect Link..gnn..have I told you how good you feel? How much I wanted you? Hoooh...how I yearned f-for your touch?” he gasped into sweaty blonde hair, eyes unfocused “B..because I do! So..so much! So very much!” 

Bless those conchs, best meal ever. He’d go through the burning ache a thousand times over it meant he could have this. Enveloped by arms and legs and slick tightness that clenched around him just right. He didn’t have to worry about being to small if Sidon’s stream of delighted cries was anything to go by. The twin cocks he would take eventually pressed against his stomach, dripping into quite the mess. He hoped Sidon was close because he could not resist for much longer and could not sign to him but he couldn’t just leave him hanging! 

Tilting his head up, he panted against Sidon’s chin before nudging against him for a kiss. It was messy, uncoordinated and he caught his lip against a tooth for just a moment. Barely a nick and he did not even feel it but Sidon did. He could taste it, taste Link and",candidate00001
"could I say? That I was his lover? I knew that could cause problems and I had already caused enough by seeing my old lover. The last thing I wanted to do was make him even angrier with me. So I just kept at it, I was so sure I would eventually find him.

It had been a week or so before I caved and called upon my old friends. Some of the goblins remembered me and, for a price of course, did some searching themselves and pointed me towards a secluded base in the Southern Barrens. So I traveled there and that’s where everything went all to hell. 

I don’t remember much of what happened. I was traveling south when the ground began to shake again. I ignored it, it had been happening often after all but then…then it got worse and worse! It was horrifying! It stumbled and grabbed onto an outcropping of rock to keep my feet and then I heard the most [i]terrible[/i] sound. The ground itself wrenched apart under my feet and the rock I was holding onto suddenly became burning to the touch. I stumbled away from it, ending up crawling with the way the ground was bucking and then the ground in front of me just opened up and I tumbled down and…and…I’m rambling again. 

It’s so hard to write…my witting keeps looping off the page. I should be resting but I have to do this, despite the burning pain on my back. I have to pour the pain out into the book for I fear I will go mad with despair.

I tumbled down, the air was so hot it hurt to inhale and everything I touched hurt me so terribly. I think I blacked out and when I next woke up, I was here in this tent. A group of knights had found me; they said I was lucky they could reach me. I had fallen into the rent in the land and luckily landed on a ledge. But I was burnt badly on my back. They were sure I would die and I wish I had! It hurts so [i]badly[/i]! Not the physical wounds, those ache and I cannot lay any way comfortably or sleep or eat but they will heal in time. What hurts is…knowing I’ve lost him! 

I’m rambling again, I think it might be what they gave me for the pain but it doesn’t touch the ache deep inside that threatens to tear me apart. When I woke up, I asked about Astoria, I remembered what his squad was and I asked about the Southern base and that’s when they told me. The base had been right where the rift had torn down. They had been going to check on those men themselves but there was nothing left. 

Aiya the pain only grows! They think me asleep and cannot hear, but I can! They talk about me now, just outside the tent. I knew my kind have always been caught up in the physical aspect of things but it never occurred to me that my wounds would matter that much. They say how beautiful I am, used to be. My back will forever be scarred from the heated air that melted rocks. It crawls across the backs of my shoulders and down towards my one side. Would Tori really spurn me for it? He might…we never exchanged words of love thought they trembled on my lips more then once. Foolish me! Everyone I love has died! I should have not gotten near Astoria, I am like a curse. Bad luck follows me around like a shroud!

[i]Nothing left![/i] Astoria…my sweet Tori was gone! That damned dragon stole him from me! I can only hope he went quick and did not suffer but I will never know. Just like I will never know the answer to any to the questions I have.

I will never know if he was angry with me. If he would forgive me for whatever it was I had done. I will never see him again, never see the way his hair caught the light when he walked. Never see the way his face lit up with a smile when I made him laugh. Oh his laugh! His laugh was always so warm and bright and…and he is gone. 

I just cannot believe that he is truly gone, I keep expecting him to come in through the flap of the tent, that worried look on his face as he comes towards me, reaching out to stroke my hair but he will not! Because he is dead! He is dead and I never got to tell him! He never knew how much he mattered to me, how happy I was to see him! I….I love him. I did not realize how much until he was gone. My heart aches so much, like a burning brand has been thrust through my chest. I cannot breathe without imagining I can smell his scent, taste him on my tongue on the air like some serpent.

"fingers well when he eased one inside. I almost laughed at the care he was giving me, as if I had never done this before but at the same time it warmed my heart. “It’s ok, I’m fine… more” I murmured against his pale chest before latching onto the pink nipple that called for me. When I said he seemed to know what he was doing, I greatly under-estimated him. He wrung moans and whimpers from me and I gave them freely but I wanted more as well. Reaching back, I urged his fingers from me and ignored the sound of annoyance he made. It changed into a low pleased chuckle when I shifted to crouch over him, face hovering above his groin. He was a sizable man and I could smell him here, thick and heavy against the back of my tongue. His fingers probed between my cheeks and I pushed back as my head lowered. Tongue stretching out, curling around the flared head and I felt rather then heard his groan, hips pressing up against me. I let it slick into my warm mouth, agile tongue sweeping any drops away to swiftly be swallowed before sucking, demanding more of him. I moaned as his fingers probed, soon a second being added and scissoring inside of me. It had been awhile since I had a lover, let alone one that made me burn with the need to feel him buried deep inside of me like this. I hollowed my cheeks sucking hard just to hear him whimper and feel his hips buck up against my mouth. I let him buck, hands in the sweet grass on either side of his hips as I kept up the suction. Focusing on the fingers, I groaned around his thick flesh as they thrust inside me at different angles, making stars burst behind my closed eyes when he hit the right spot. Apparently letting him know he had got the right spot with a muffled cry only enticed him to abuse that spot, making my body buck against his fingers as he added a third. 

Cock popping free from my lips with an audible sound, I sucked in a ragged gasp. “Give me the oil.” I demanded, voice rough. When he didn’t respond beyond thrusting his fingers again, I raised my hand, bringing it down with a slap against the side of his cock. I felt his body jolt under me, a startled yelp leaving him and I grin. Who was boring now hunh? Lifting myself, I swiftly spun, hands shoving his shoulders back down to the ground and holding him there. He didn’t expect that of me and I had him still in surprise but that wouldn’t last long. Casting my eyes about, I spotted the small vial and reached out to snag it, dumping it carelessly onto the hard flesh under me, tossing the vial away before reaching to spread it over his cock. It felt just as thick in my mouth as it did in my hand and I purred, straddling him and lowering myself down.

I teased us both by stopping just as he started to slide inside and just rubbed him there, lifting up when he bucked, denying us both what we wanted. I waited, watching his face as strong hands grabbed my hips and tried to force me down. Tendons stood out on his neck, marked with my teeth and that gave me a jolt of perverse pleasure. Wild eyes opened to stare up at me, teeth baring just slightly as he spoke. “Stop teasing! Fuck, come on! You filthy son-of-a-bitch! Let me fuck you! You know you fucking want my cock!” I dropped, tossing my head back with a loud echoing shout, feeling myself be spread and filled so full, so fucking good it made every nerve flare and pulse. There was pain, I could feel it as a distant unimportant feeling and I hissed eagerly, eyes rolling back in my head. I could hear him under him; feel his hands tightening on my hips. I knew I would have bruises, I always bruised so easily with my skin but I welcomed the marks. This was what I wanted, what I needed ever since we started our unusual foreplay of snipping back and forth at each other, each word firing us up more and more until the need had crested into this…thing. Wild and untameable, like a dragon raging through our veins. 

I was barely aware of moving, balancing myself on the balls of my feet and using strong leg muscles to raise myself up to let gravity take care of dropping down. My hands braced their weight on his shoulders, still holding him down, claiming him in a way most wouldn’t think of being anything other then submitting but just because I took him into my body didn’t mean I was not on top. Soon enough, I gave up the position of complete control and just felt. Neither one of us was in control, we moved together. I rose up and dropped as his hips snapped upwards, hands pulling me down against him hard. It wasn’t gentle or sweet, it was hard and fast and we were both",candidate00001
"saw an opening and lunged, blade whistling through the air as he got past Volga’s reach. The strike would have his his shoulder if it were not for the massive claw that suddenly caught his blade and Link barely got his shield up in time to block the spear though his arm throbbed slightly.

They froze, eyes locked as they both realized they were at a bit of an impasse. Link’s sword was caught fast, a faint trickle of blood sliding down the metal but Volga could not let go to use his much closer ranged claw. The angle of his spear was no good either, but if he backed up  then it put himself off balance for the split second Link would need to free his sword.

Blue met green, neither moving for seconds that seemed to stretch between them, a yawning space that panting breaths and the creak of armor filled. This close and Link could feel the heat that seemed to radiate from the dragon knight, doing nothing to stop the beads of sweat that trickled down the sides of his  face and he could see that Volga was no better.

In the end, who could say who moved first but to call it a kiss would be a disservice. It was teeth and tongue and the metallic tang of blood from lips caught between teeth. Volga was the first to drop his guard, spear clanging to the stones to free his hand to fist in the iconic green tunic to yank the shorter male closer. The shield followed soon after, a bit harder to drop then simply opening his hand but it was left behind as Volga backed him towards a fallen wall. 

Claw vanished at the same time the sword was dropped, instantly forgotten in favor of pressing close despite all the armor preventing any ability to feel anything. 

Volga’s kiss was hot, both in actual temperature and in the way it made his body react and it didn’t take a dragons senses to tell Volga wasn’t fairing any better. Not if the low vibrations that Link had realized was growling was any indication.

No time, they had no time. Who knew how long they had been fighting? It could have been minutes, or long enough that someone would come looking  for them. With that thought in mind, it was a quick fumble of who and where and how before Link solved it by turned and bracing himself with a forearm on the rubble, free hand fumbling to free himself off his pants. It felt like a flame pressed along his back and he was sure the skin on the back of his neck was turning pink from the puffs of Volga’s breath but that was swiftly forgotten when claws dragged over his hips to shove everything down to his thighs. he was sure he’d been nicked,  blood trickling down his skin but he relished the prick of pain as he sank his teeth into his glove, yank it off and hear it fall with a slap below him. 

Volga’s armor was a bit trickier but it gave Link time to slick his fingers with spit and reach back behind himself. It wasn’t much, not much at all and nowhere near enough. he’d feel it later, when the adrenaline had worn off and the pain returned but he doubted he would regret it. There was a shuffle and then the sound of spitting before Link jumped at the feel of it against his ass but he didn’t stop. There was no time, no time and this was not the place and both were aware, neither cared nor stopped.

Not when gloved claws pricked at the skin of Link’s hip to pull  them back as the Hero bent at the waist and braced himself on the stone. Not when a thick cock, hot so hot like an ember and it hurt but it hurt so good, pressed against his spit slicked entrance before Link stuffed his other glove into his mouth to muffle the grunt of pain. 

Too soon, a hand gripped the back of Link’s collar to drag him back onto his cock and too soon because surely he would tear, the spit and slick from the dragon knights cock wasn’t enough but if he did? It wasn’t noticed.

Not when the world narrowed  down to moments, slivers of time and things that would become memories to be savored where there was was time for it.

Right now Misha is at home with Vicki and the kids and Jensen is with Jared in his trailer, home too far away for just one night. The polling stations are closing state by state, and the map on the big screen tv, with its mostly red and not enough blue blocks, is a constantly evolving yet horrifying nightmare. It’s too much like watching a deadly train wreck in slow motion.

There are two simultaneous Skype chats open – Danneel and Gen on one laptop, curled up together on the couch at Jared’s place, evidence of future generations in their swollen bellies, and the other a picture of Misha’s living room with Vicki on the floor, her back against the couch and Misha pacing with a twisted look on his face that Jensen isn’t sure if he even recognises. Jensen tries to place it. He’s seen Misha both sad and angry, and although there’s a measure of both there, neither is quite fitting. When Misha turns to face him and their eyes lock, the only word that comes to him is disgust. Disgust at the man who is turning his beloved country into a freak show. Disgust at the blind half of that same country that seems to think the sun shines out of his racist, misogynistic, homophobic ass. And Jensen’s heart breaks as he realizes he even sees disgust in Misha’s beautiful blue eyes at himself for not doing enough to stop it.

 

Wednesday – Sadness

The day after is the hardest. Jensen needs to be on set early so he Facetimes both Danneel and Misha first thing, one right after another. No, neither of them has really slept. Yes, they’ve already spoken to each other. Neither of these facts surprises Jensen. His wife’s beautiful inner strength and ability to see things with positivity buoys him a little and he’s eternally grateful she’s his and that’s she’s empathic enough to know that Misha would have needed that strength this morning.

Misha is a wreck. Jensen isn’t sure what he expected, but broken wasn’t it. He can hear the crack in Misha’s voice as he tries to relay some cute story of Maison’s escapades with maple syrup that morning, but as much as Misha adores his little girl, Jensen can tell it’s just a distraction – a distraction from waking up to a new reality. It’s a reality Misha put so much of his heart and soul into to trying to prevent and Jensen can see in the liquid blue eyes that his heart is in pieces. It’s taking every ounce of willpower Jensen has not to just hop onto Highway 1 and head south. Misha is so close, yet so far in this moment and Jensen needs to help him, in a more physical way. What he’s doing now isn’t enough. It will never be enough.

Mid-morning, Misha posts a fifteen second video on Facebook and Jensen’s heart breaks. He can tell by the comments that fandom is hurting with him. They care so much for Misha – well most of them – and he has never been so glad for Misha’s ability to look past the hate. He will only see the good in people like always and he’ll be lifted by the heartfelt love that his fans are sending. He’s never considered them fans really, just friends, and that’s fitting right now because he needs all the friends he can get.

Jensen heads back to his trailer to make a quick phone call. He needs to hear Misha’s voice. He needs to tell him that he loves him – that he believes in him, and that no matter what, they’re in this together.

 

Thursday – Anger

Misha’s back on set on Thursday and Jensen is beyond relieved. They’re never good at being apart, but the last few days have been agonizing. When he left Misha on Sunday in New Jersey, he’d been foolishly complacent, almost to the point of wondering why Misha and Darius were even bothering with their trip to Ohio. Hillary had this, right? The online polls all showed it was practically in the bag. How had he been so stupid?

The day begins with desperate kisses in Misha’s trailer. With the pent up emotion of the past four days, it’s not surprising that it turns physical. What starts as clinging quickly ends up as fucking, and awareness barely kicks in before they’re both panting and coming and Misha is slipping out of Jensen and flopping down beside him on his unmade bed.

Jensen can still see the sadness from the day before, but there’s something else there today as well. It’s not until later, when they’ve made it through the first half of their shooting day, had their lunch break, checked the reaction tweets from that night’s episode (and somehow Dean has fittingly killed Hitler), that Misha tweets as himself for only the second time since Monday. He’s fucking angry. Misha berates",candidate00002
"Hey!  Nice to meet you.” Jensen mumbled, rubbing the back of his neck.  It was a nervous habit he had, one that even bled into his Dean persona, and Misha recognised it for exactly what it was.  “How do you know Misha and Vicki?”

Jeff seemed to cozy up a little closer to Vicki as he took his time answering Jensen’s question.  Vicki pulled away a bit, clearly uncomfortable about something.  “We’ve known each other for years; met on a retreat in Thailand, actually.  We spent a lot of time together before West here was born.” he leaned over to muss up West’s hair and the boy giggled.

Misha glanced over to where Jensen was staring at the laptop screen, hoping the innuendo in Jeff’s comment had gone over his head, but Misha could see in Jensen’s eyes exactly when the full extent of what Jeff was hinting at crossed his friend’s mind.

Jensen quickly backed up to the door of the trailer, almost tripping over the leg of a small table in his haste to leave, but yet not willing to take his eyes off Misha’s worried face.  Misha felt like a deer in the headlights, stunned silent and unsure of what to say or do, just knowing that he had to fix this, had to come up with an answer to the questioning expression on his lover’s face that was currently boring into his soul.

“Jen, wait!  Please?”

Jensen chose that moment to break eye contact and turn around, heading out the door and letting the metal screen spring back with a bang, causing it to echo across the industrial looking lot.  Misha slammed the laptop shut, knowing his empathic wife would totally understand his need to go after Jensen.  He had some explaining to do to get him to understand the part of him and Vicki’s past that they hadn’t opened up about in detail with Jensen or Jared.

It had clouded over again in the short time since Misha had been outside.  There was an ominous feel to the greyness that matched the hard lump in his chest as his footsteps clanged down the metal steps of his trailer. He glanced around the lot, taking in the familiar scene of the crew at work loading props, the flatbeds of equipment being readied for the location shoot later that night, the cars in the parking lot, and the PA’s and assistants milling around.  The place felt like a second home to Misha after eight years, but even that familiarity wasn’t calming his racing heart.  Right now, his biggest priority was making things right with the man that he loved.  Yes, that was it; he was in love with Jensen, and the fear of possibly losing that love so soon after realizing it was tearing him apart.

His first stop was Jensen’s trailer.  It seemed like the obvious place the man would go if he wanted to be alone, but there was no sign of him and the door was locked.  Misha ran to the food tent, glancing around and only seeing a handful of people grabbing coffee at an hour too early for lunch.  Checking the make-up and wardrobe trailers proved fruitless as well.  No one had seen Jensen and Misha was becoming frantic.  As a last resort, he checked Jared’s trailer.  Maybe Jensen hadn’t wanted to be alone with his thoughts after all.

Jared answered Misha’s incessant knocking and just opened the door wide to let him in.  “I’m gonna go lift for a bit at the gym.  You guys should talk.”

Misha glanced over to the couch where Jensen sat, head in his hands, looking as dejected as Misha had ever seen him.

Misha nodded.  “Thanks, Jar.”

Jared pulled him into a side hug, enveloping him as only Jared could.  “You bet, brother.  Fix this, okay?  I don’t know what happened here, but you’re my best friends and I need you both to be happy.”

Misha closed the door gently behind Jared and leaned back against it, watching the expression on Jensen’s face and waiting to see if he would speak first.  Although he got that Jensen had been blindsided by Jeff, it’s not like the other man didn’t have at least a vague idea about he and Vicki’s past.  He could see that something had gotten under Jensen’s skin, but he needed to know exactly what so he could understand and attempt to make it right.

When it became clear that Jensen wasn’t going to be the one to start the conversation, Misha walked over and gently perched on the arm of the couch.  Fearful of making an unwelcome advance, he stuffed his hands in his pockets and turned to face the man in front of him.  “Jensen?  Talk to me.  Please?”

Jensen raised his head to look at him and Misha could see the hurt in his eyes.  Not touching wasn’t an option.  Misha slid down onto the couch cushion and wrapped his arms around the man beside him, pulling him close against his chest.  To Misha’s",candidate00002
"unexpected, and after the previous weekend, more than a little awkward. Jensen moved forward, side-stepping Misha in the processed, and closed the apartment door behind them. “What are you doing here, Mish?”

Misha wandered into the small kitchen and grabbed a half-finished craft beer from the counter. He lifted it up to show Jensen. “Want one? Then we can talk.”

Jensen nodded, shrugging of his damp jacket and slinging it over the back of the couch. He joined his friend by the fridge, taking the offered bottle and tipping it back between his lips. He ran his fingers through his damp hair and looked up at Misha who, much like his onscreen counterpart, hadn’t stopped staring directly at him since he’d walked in.

The look of pure desire darkening Misha’s crystal blue eyes caught Jensen off guard. He observed his friend’s interested gaze roam from the bottle at his lips, down his chest and arms, to his crotch; his jeans slightly damp from where his jacket hadn’t covered below the waist. Jensen’s dick twitched in response to the scrutiny, not an unwelcome reaction, just not the one he needed right now when they really needed to talk.

Jensen turned towards the living room, needing to release himself from Misha’s heated stare. “Misha, you still haven’t told me why you’re here. Really.”

Misha followed him and took a seat on the leather couch, patting the space beside him. “Sit down, Jen. Sounds like you’re having second thoughts about what happened between us up at Whistler. Talk to me. You can tell me anything. You know that.”

Jensen took a seat beside his friend, careful not to get too close. He needed to keep his head clear, and lord knows Misha’s close proximity was already making that difficult. He looked up at Misha and saw the concerned and troubled look in his eyes. That was all it took for him to realize he needed to clear the doubt in his friend’s mind.

“It’s not so much second thoughts, Mish,” Jensen started, voice cracking slightly. “I loved what we did! It was such an amazing weekend and I can’t thank you enough for opening my eyes to the possibilities between us. I’ve ignored it for too long. It’s more…guilt, you know?”

“Yes, I think I get it. Vicki and I have always viewed love and monogamy as something that can be shared with the right person; that opening your heart to another only increases love and passion as long as everyone is on the same page. You weren’t raised that way. You come from a traditional, Christian family, Jen. You’ve been taught that you give yourself to your one and only for life. It’s really difficult to go against years of conditioning. “

Jensen sighed with relief. Misha did get it even if he hadn’t at first. “I think that’s exactly it. I know Danneel’s good with it. Hell, when I told her about our adventure in the hot tub I think she was actually excited about it. I wouldn’t be surprised if she was getting off on the idea like all the fan girls on Twitter,” he laughed, blushing from his chest to the tips of his ears.

“The ladies do enjoy the idea of two men together, Jen.”

Jensen nodded. “Yeah, I know man. Damn, have you seen that Cockles tag? Some of the fan art and photo manips are intense!”

Misha laughed, his eyes crinkling at the corners. “Have you read any of the fan fiction?”

“They write about us? Not just Destiel?”

“Oh yeah, Jen. I’ll have to check out Tumblr and find you a bedtime story one night,” Misha replied, his gummy grin widening. Jensen couldn’t help but smile at his friend’s infectious laughter.”

“Sounds like I need to get with the program then. My wife loves the idea, your wife is on board, the fans are all over it, only thing holding us back is me apparently.”

“I’m not pushing you,” Misha reminded. “This is on your terms, if at all. I can’t say I won’t be disappointed if you don’t want to take this any further, but I get it.”

“Misha, if there’s one thing I’m sure of, it’s that I want you. Fuck, you make me feel desired and wanted in a way that’s so different from Danni, you know?”

Misha closed the distance between them, climbing effortlessly into Jensen’s lap, lifting Jensen’s chin with a single long finger and staring determinedly into his friend’s eyes. “Oh yes, Jen. I definitely know.”

Their lips crashed together with instant heat. Jensen groaned into the kiss, bucking his half hard erection into Misha’s, completely on board with the current",candidate00002
", leaving him and Misha alone for a moment before the crowds moved in.  “Thanks for the post-its yesterday, babe.  You’re spoiling me,” Jensen whispered, slipping his hand in Misha’s and giving it a quick squeeze.  “I enjoyed one of your kisses last night, right before I had to fix my short-sheeted bed.”  Misha pulled him in for a hug.  “You know you love me anyway.”  They reluctantly pulled apart and Jensen nodded with a soft smile.  “Now get out of here and let me work, Dmitri.”    “As you wish, Jackles,” Misha smirked, and turned to sneak out the side door.  Jensen went to grab his phone out of his back pocket to check for any texts before starting the photo op line, and stuck to it was yet another post-it, this time yellow, and a few hand-written words.  ‘You said your heart was a trapdoor.  We kept falling through.’ – Rebecca Lindenberg  If the first few fans wondered why Jensen had such a sappy smile on his face in their photo ops, it would only be speculation anyway.  Jensen soon found out that post-it notes were a bit of a Vegas convention theme.  With the memory loss episode having just aired that week, fans had jumped on the bandwagon in photo ops and he and Jared were being stuck with the damn things all day.  He couldn’t help but smile when he realized that Misha had been ahead of the game.  It didn’t surprise him.  The man was always a leader, never a follower.  The pace of the afternoon went quickly.  Photos, meet and greet, afternoon panel, then more photos.  He loved conventions.  He genuinely enjoyed spending time with the fans, his SPN family, but it was exhausting as well.  He stopped in the green room for a Redbull before heading up for photo ops with Misha.  Jensen always wanted to be on his game for those.  The fans loved their playful interactions, and so did he.  Misha and Jared were just finishing up when he entered through the side door.  He stood to the side, moving his hips to the music, watching the last few fans enjoy their time with his friends.  The few seconds they got with their idols was so important to them, it always warmed his heart.  Even after so many years, it still amazed him the impact the show had on people; the family that they’d somehow created.  It was humbling and something he was insurmountably proud of.  While he’d been lost in thought, the photo op line had finished, and Misha and Jared had wandered over.  “What cloud was your head lost on?” Jared asked, between chugs from a bottle of water.  Jensen shook his head to clear it.  “Just appreciating what we have.”  Misha nodded, clearly understanding where Jensen was coming from.  “So, Jen.  You ready to go play Destiel?”  “Pretty sure most of the time they have us playing ourselves, Mish.  You know that, right?”  “Of course,” Misha smirked.  “So let’s go give them what they want.”  Jared rolled his eyes.  “You two are gross and I’m outta here before the eye-fucking starts.”   Jensen figured that was their cue to be as gross as possible in sort of polite company, at least in front of volunteers and Chris, so he tipped his head onto Misha’s shoulder and fluttered his eyelashes directly at Jared.  His giant friend backed out of the room with his hands in the air as if to say, I give up.  Jensen grabbed Misha possessively by the arm and danced them over to the backdrop.  “Let’s do this!”  Photo ops with Misha were always the most fun.  They chose some upbeat classic rock and Chris played along.  Some of the poses requested of them were ridiculous, and some were downright dirty.  Some they had to say no to just on principle, but others they had fun with.  The ones where they needed to be close, they often took advantage of, touching each other as much as they could get away with, squeezing hands, rubbing shoulders, caressing chests; they played it up for the fans, and they enjoyed it for each other.   About half way through the line, they stopped for a moment to grab a few sips of water from the nearby table.  Jensen slipped his phone from his back pocket and swiped to check for messages as he had a tendency to do whenever he had a minute – a habit he’d gotten into since becoming a father.  All he’d missed was a recent text from Misha.  He glanced up at the man in question who just gave him a knowing grin.  Tapping to open the text, all he saw was a photo of another post-it, this one bright blue.  Jensen enlarged the photo to be able to read the writing on the note.  “You must not ever stop being whimsical. And you must not, ever, give anyone else the responsibility for your life.” – Mary Oliver  Jensen couldn’t help but place",candidate00002
"his racing heart and will down his semi-hard cock.  He didn’t need to get himself hurt because he wasn’t paying attention.  A few deep breaths later, he let Sid know he was ready and he got himself into position.

Jensen intentionally avoided looking in Misha’s direction when Sid shifted the lever to edge Larry onto high speed.  The difference was obvious but manageable.  He had to work at keeping himself seated on the bull this time, which would make the take look realistic.  When the bull slowed at the end of the eight seconds, he was hopeful they could finish in one take.  His thighs were beginning to ache from clenching, and his arm was getting tired from being held up so long.  He was reminded yet again that he was no longer twenty-two.

There was some shuffling around before the next ride as the crew got ready to film.  Jensen chanced a peek at Misha and was surprised to see the man no longer there.  Deciding that was probably for the best, he centered all of his focus on getting the scene done in one take.  One of the stylists came over to brush some powder on his face and fluff up his hair.  Then, it was only a matter of minutes before the scene was called and Jensen rode his ride like the pro-Cowboy Dean would try to be.  As an afterthought, he flopped backwards as the bull slowed, knowing it would stretch his shirt across his abs and show off his belt buckle.  It seemed right in the moment, like something Dean would do.  Whether they’d use it or not, who knew. 

After catching his breath, Jensen rolled to the side just in time to see a mop of dark hair disappear out the door.  He kept rolling until he landed flat on his back on the safety mat that occupied the section of the bar that surrounded the mechanical bull.

“Hey, John?  Am I good for a while?”  Jensen groaned, really starting to feel some muscles he didn’t know he had as he struggled to get to his feet.

“For sure!  You’ve got at least a couple of hours until we need you again.  We’ve got lunch and then Jared’s coverage.  I’ll watch the time and sent one of the PA’s over when I’ve got a better estimate,” John replied, already nose deep in the script for the next scene.

Jensen scrambled off the uneven mat and wandered over to the bar to grab a bottle of water.  As he walked he reached around to pull his phone out of his back pocket.  He swiped the screen and saw he had a couple of texts from Danneel just to say hi and wish him luck with Larry, a missed call from his agency, and a text from Misha. 

Your trailer – M

The last flushed look on Misha’s face, the clenched fist, the roll of his hips came flooding back and Jensen didn’t need to be told twice.  He stuffed the phone back in his pocket, took a giant swig of water, and strode purposely out towards his trailer.

The man in question was sitting on the unmade bed, nose buried in something on his phone.  Jensen dropped his own phone and keys on the counter and strolled over, enjoying the indignant look on Misha’s face when he grabbed the offending phone out of his hand and pushed him backwards, easily straddling his thighs.  He held the phone high up in the air, out of Misha’s reach.

“Oh my God, Jen.  I’ve seen you in that exact position so many times today,” Misha teased, clearly enjoying the view of Jensen in such a familiar pose.  “Thighs clenched, arm in the air showing off the lines of your body.  I swear you were just doing it to make me crazy.”  He punched the last few words with a slight roll of his hips, apparently just to make his point.

Misha’s tone had changed from light and teasing to suggestive and heated.  Jensen tossed the phone to the side and leaned down to bracket Misha’s head with his arms.

 “Well, I would say I did it all for you, Dmitri, but since you weren’t supposed to be on set today…”  Jensen’s train of thought was interrupted when Misha swallowed, highlighting his unshaven jaw. Inhaling Misha’s scent as he leaned in, Jensen relished the feel of Misha’s whiskers tickling his chin and cheeks.  He nipped and licked his way around the shell of Misha’s ear and then down the side of his neck to where his shirt collar halted his progress.  Sitting back up, he worked the buttons on Misha’s shirt, reclaiming a little of his power of speech as he did so.

“So, yeah.  Uh, why are you here anyway?”

Misha’s breaths grew shorter as Jensen’s feather light touches flicked his shirt buttons open.  “Uh, needed to drop some Nexus paperwork off at the border. Figured I’d stop by and see you.”

Jensen pressed the heel of his palm into the",candidate00002
"and the last time we spoke you made it quite clear I was to stay away from you and your problems.” 

Dean didn’t know where to start. There were too many things to say and there had been too much already left unsaid. Dean sighed. “I don’t know. I guess I just wanted to make sure you were alright.”

 “I assure you I’m fine. Thank you.”

Cas’ formal tone was a little unexpected. Dean had assumed they would fall back into comfortable friendship. He found himself more than a little frustrated with Cas’ apparent disregard for something Dean thought had been important to both of them but he supposed he had some amends he needed to make before he could expect anything different.

“Cas,” Dean started, stopping just as quickly and turning to look straight into Cas’ solemn face.

With little regard to how Cas might react, Dean took a deep breath and began to speak. With the culmination of his feelings over the past years mingled with his frustration in Cas’ apparent lack of caring, he found himself suddenly spilling out everything he needed to say. 

“I’m so sorry! I needed to make sure you weren’t still hurt. I needed to know if the last few days affected you the same way they did me because I’ve been beating myself up inside wondering if I’m ever even gonna see you again, man. I had to see if you cared enough to come back; if our friendship meant anything to you.” Dean’s gaze drifted downwards and wondered if he would regret his next words. “I had to find out if you think about me in the same way I dream about you. I had to know, Cas, because the not knowing is tearing me apart.”

Dean sank to the floor. His fear of rejection prevented him from looking up. He fully expected Cas to leave him there, slumped on the floor, shivering in the admission of his feelings, knowing that he had just laid everything he had ever known on the line in just a few short minutes.

It seemed like a lifetime he sat on the threadbare rug with his head on his knees. The light touch on his shoulder surprised him and his heartbeat quickened at the gesture. Cas was still there after everything Dean had just said.

“Dean.” Dean looked up slowly, in awe at the sudden change in Cas’ tone.

Cas slid his fingers gently down Dean’s arm, just a feather-light touch, eventually reaching his hand and pulling the shaking man to his feet. Standing face to face, Cas lightly ran his palm down Dean’s cheek to his chin and lifted his face with just one soft finger until their eyes met.

Dean leaned into Cas’ touch. “You were the one thing I could count on, Cas. I never expected to feel this way, not about you, not about anyone really, but the truth is I do, and now I don’t know how to act, or think, or what to do and frankly it scares the hell outta me.” 

Dean held his breath as Cas closed the last of the distance between them and brushed his lips against Dean’s in the lightest of kisses, a barely audible sigh escaping as he melted against him. Dean felt his body relax with sweet relief as he leaned in to return the kiss. His hands automatically found their way behind Cas’ head, feathering his fingers into Cas’ unruly hair.

“Cas,” Dean whispered, his body automatically reacting to the closeness he had denied himself for so long and that he so desperately needed. He gently brought his hands around, cradling Cas’ face in his palms and captured the angel’s warm, dry lips with his own yet again. This kiss was more urgent. His head was spinning and he realized his hands were shaking as his emotions caught up with the actions of his body. Cas’ hand moved around to the jut of Dean’s hip, tugging him closer by his belt loop.

“I never realized,” Cas murmured against Dean’s cheek, stubble grazing. “I wanted you. For so many years I got your attention the only way I knew how. Then we became friends and I needed you, needed this, but I didn’t know how to ask.”

Dean was flooded with feeling at Cas’ unexpected words. How he wished he known. Maybe that would have given him the strength he needed to do this then. Maybe it would have changed the way things were now.

“Shhhhhh,” Dean whispered, his breath warming Cas’ cheek. “We’re here now, and that’s all that matters.” 

With those words he kissed Cas again with months, years, of pent up emotion and need. His tongue parted Cas’ flushed lips and found heat and warmth inside.

Cas kissed back with just as much urgency, allowing Dean’s tongue to sweep across his tongue and teeth. His hands found the hem of Dean’s old t-shirt and slid underneath, finding toned muscles and soft flesh. Dean’s",candidate00002
"clavicle, softly scratching with his chin until he reached a firm nipple, wasting no time catching it between his teeth and biting down gently.

Jensen cried out at the pain and pleasure of it. “Shit! Yessss!” He was so fucking thankful Misha knew not to be gentle with him after so long. He’d need softness later, and Jensen knew he’d get it, but right now he wanted to feel it. He was desperate and aching and he craved hard and raw.

Misha had worked his way down to Jensen’s hip bones, leaving whisker burn and teeth marks in his wake. Jensen was rock hard against his stomach and leaking a wet spot on his boxer briefs, but Misha just ignored his cock for now, choosing instead to switch sides and give the other hip the same treatment. Once Jensen was marked up to his satisfaction, Misha tugged the waistband of his briefs as her went and nuzzled his prickly chin over Jensen’s balls wasting no time in licking a stripe up the underside of his cock.

“Fuck. I will never not be surprised by that fucking tongue, baby,” Jensen groaned. “It’s almost as long as my dick!”

Misha chuckled around the tip of Jensen’s rigid cock as he mouthed around the top, tonguing at the slit, obviously enjoying the breathy moans he was eliciting from Jensen at his actions. “Sounds like that’s a compliment to both of us,” he replied, before sucking Jensen all the way down to the base.

Jensen had to fist his hands into the sheets to stop himself from thrusting into the warm suction of Misha’s wicked mouth. He knew Misha could take it, hell, he knew Misha loved it when Jensen fucked up into his face, but Misha hadn’t asked yet and Jensen would try to hold back until he did.

He glanced up to see Misha staring at him, blue eyes dark with lust. Jensen could feel the heat starting to pool in his belly from just watching the mop of sex-crazed dark hair bobbing up and down leaving his dick damp with saliva and Misha’s lips moist and stretched wide.

Before Jensen could get too caught up in the repetitiveness of one sensation, he a felt the pad of finger press firmly against his hole. There was no attempt to push inside, just a firm pressure – a solid presence of, yes. Yes, right there.

Misha pulled off, fisting Jensen’s cock instead to free up his mouth and worked his way down to suck each of Jensen’s balls into his mouth, circling them one at a time with his talented tongue and surrounding them with warm, wet heat. Jensen groaned at the roughness of Misha’s stubble against his perineum, sensitivity overload making it difficult to articulate what he wanted – but Misha knew. Misha always knew. The long, slender fingers surrounding his cock stopped stroking, leaving him sitting wet and heavy against his belly and suddenly there were two strong, eager hands on the flesh of his ass spreading him wide.

Jensen held his breath. They’d only done this once before and it had blown him away, sending him into almost instantaneous orgasm as soon as Misha had reached up and nudged his dick. Eager at the prospect, Jensen scrambled to turn over. Even as Misha maneuvered their limbs into place he was shoving his own underwear down – apparently glad to be rid of them.

Jensen was soon feeling the insistent tug of his elastic waist band being pulled over his cheeks and the warmth of their cocoon was lost into the room. The cooler air hitting his cheeks was a rush of sensation. Spreading his knees apart to make room for Misha, he arched his back and pulled his ass into the air. He didn’t consider the neediness of the act; he didn’t have to. That was one thing he’d grown to love about being with Misha, there was simply no shame. Misha encouraged his desires without judgement or preconceived ideas and he lived to bring them both pleasure.

“Please, Mish,” Jensen keened, feeling his ass quiver in anticipation. He could feel his friend leaning up over him and heard Misha let out a soft rumble of contented laughter as he scritched his beard over ready cheek mounds.

Jensen snickered, though the sound was muffled in his pillow, fueled by his lover’s playful mood. He felt strong hands clamp down and shove him into the mattress and waited for what he knew was coming – a warm, wet tongue dragging down between his cheeks.

He was putty now, putty in Misha’s capable hands. He let his limbs go numb as he felt his underwear tugged the rest of the way down his legs. Then a shot of electricity shot up his spine as he felt fingers peeling his cheeks apart.

A moment later, the scruff was back. It tickled its way up his inner thighs and prickled the tender skin of his perineum before hot breath finally passed over his hole. Beneath him, pressed into the bedding, his cock pulsed with excitement as a flicking of tongue teased his entrance and he felt his hole twitching in response",candidate00002
"he would have been grudgingly proud, but his own luck was fucked up and tainted everything and everyone around him.

No reason to not have a cigarette then.

Except. He'd just beat lung cancer. The hard way, because it didn't get much harder than ol' Nick ripping them out of your chest.

There was always the air outside for a little pollution, free of charge, so he opened his office window.

He wasn't sure what to do now. Part of him wanted a direction, part of him wanted to score some payback, but Gabriel was already paying one way or another and that left him where? Sitting in a dingy office, aimless, pondering whether to start drinking at 9 in the morning.

And then the Gates on his arms started to prickle with that feeling that there was an entity close by.That was what he got for opening a window. Windows were doors in more ways than the standard breaking and entering way. John left it open, let the humid night air waft in while he turned to put his back to the wall. Ready to use that window as a door, just in case he had to.

""Hey boss.""

The voice was startlingly familiar, as was the face and hesitant grin that appeared from the shadows.

He didn't move for a long moment, three, four heartbeats, while he wondered if it was a shape-shifter or a ghost come back to get him, or... Or if it had been malicious, he would've already been dead. Twice over.

""Chas?""

""Pretty much,"" Chas stepped forward and his reason  for lurking became clear. Wings. Big fucking angel wings, looking ruffled.

They were never white like in the pictures. Not really. The ones whose wings were white were pure, full host, not half, and the rest of them probably used spells, glamors or good old bleach. Chas's looked natural, white and grey mottled together, but John didn't reach out to touch them even if he wanted to. Didn't do much more than stare, at the wings, at Chas. ""Shouldn't you be in heaven?""

""Hey, you couldn't even get me to stay in the car, and you're a lot more scary than they are,"" Chas replied trying to sit on the edge of the desk. ""No one seemed to really cope with the fact that I don't have a compulsion to obey anyone.""

""They kicked you out?"" John moved in to steady his desk lamp as a wing edge smushed slowly into it, because that was the only thing he could think to say, like it was normal and casual and Chas was just asking to crash on his sofa for a night.

""More a case of I wandered out the door,"" Chas smirked. ""I'm too low on the ladder for anyone to give a toss y'know?. So..you need a driver?""

God.

John exhaled, tried to not let it sound as shakey as it felt coming out of his chest. ""Jesus, you're supposed to be fucking dead. That psychotic angel killed you.""

""Pretty much why I got my wings,"" Chas answered. ""And you know what? I kinda figured that if there was any poor bastard who needed a half assed guardian angel it would be you.""

Half-assed was right. He was standing too close to Chas, sliding the lamp into something like a safer position, trying to not feel the energy that was coming off of him. “I could use a full assed guardian angel, if you know someone who’s offering. I…”

Chas leaned forward and it was that same excitable grin. ""Unless you've found someone to replace me already?""

He couldn’t hold back the snort he gave. “Are you kidding? No one sane’d volunteer.”

""So you're up for an angel with a dubious sense of sanity?"" Chas replied. ""I thought you'd seen me rise anyway. Lifted from Perdition they call it.  Fancy way of saying things.""

“Well, you’d have to be insane to come back down here. With everything that happened, with everything…” That could happen again. Except that Chas had wings, wings and John didn’t know what else. Superhuman strength. Heat. Warmth when he leaned in and almost kissed him.

There is was, that look in his eyes. Totally inappropriate hero-worship. At least he had thought it was blind hero-worship but perhaps it had been something else all along. Something a little more base than Hero worship, something a little more frightening to feel coming off of an angel, even if Chas still looked like Chas, without the goofy hat. “I’m not barking up the wrong tree, am I?”

""No."" Chas' smile was dazzling and he looked like an angel should, lit up with something in his face rather than the ass-holish arrogance of the others. ""You have the Sight for the",candidate00003
"doors open.""

It sounded so much more bitter and acrimonious than any argument he and Molly ever had. There was the silent treatment, slammed doors, and then she'd sneak up behind him when he was smoking on the porch, and lay her head on his shoulder. Easy as that, enough to get either of them to apologize for whatever the hell it was. ""I know that saying 'I'm sorry' right now doesn't mean a thing. But I wish you hadn't had to go through that to end up here.""

Jim smiled a little. ""Yeah. Thanks. It's Ellie that I regret. I don't regret anything else, but I regret what it did to her.""

 

Of course he would. Jim didn't talk about Ellie much but he had a picture in his wallet. Most of the department didn't even know there was an Ellie. ""When she's an adult, hopefully she'll understand what happened.""

Jim shook his head. ""I doubt it. Janice will have put the blame on me, I know that much. She doesn't think I know but... well, I found out and that was the beginning of the end. I never had a daughter, Gil. Not really. And I was so wounded by that I let it drive me away from the nearest thing... right up to Vegas.""

""You never had a daughter?"" Gil frowned for a moment, and of course reality followed shortly after the thought. ""She wasn't yours.""

""That's right. My best friend Mike, on the force."" Jim shrugged again. ""Who incidentally I turned in along with a load of other Jersey cops for playing dirty. But by then, there was nothing left there for me, you know?""

""And when there's nothing left, there's nothing to do but move on."" Gil's mouth twitched a little as he looked down at the book he'd been reading. Jim called it shit, but it was something popular he'd picked up to keep himself busy while Gil had been spending most of his time sleeping. As far as crime novels went, Gil had read better in reports, but it was amusing to nitpick it in his head. ""I ended up out here because this is where Jack helped me set up.""

""Don't tell me that,"" Jim replied. ""I don't need a reason to be grateful to Jack. I'll tell you something, in Jersey? He would have had a mysterious accident pretty quickly.""

""It's a shame we weren't up a little further north instead of in Maryland."" Gil rubbed at his temple. ""I couldn't ever hurt Jack. I've just been tempted occasionally. It was my fault for agreeing to take the jobs.""

""Like you really had a choice,"" Jim said poking a knife into his vegetables to see how long they needed. ""Let me guess it was like a scene out of... one of those movies Archie always goes on about. Help us, Gil, you're our only hope! What are you meant to say to that? No? I'm taking time out from saving lives?""

""I was,"" Gil shrugged. ""I was working as a coroner. I managed to dodge him at work, but he caught up with me at home. It was... he showed me pictures of the two families. When they were alive."" Emotional manipulation, but Jack was good for a reason. That was what Jack did. ""The deal was that he was going to protect me. I should have known better by then. But you can still be young and stupid at thirty.""

""Yeah, look at Sanders,"" Jim grinned a little. ""I still reckon that Crawford is lazy. From what I hear, our guys are managing to piece things together.""

""How's that lazy?"" Gil glanced up at Jim, watching that grin. He was glad that even if he was there being a problem, Jim could at least still smile. ""He came in, stirred everyone up, and they're doing his work for him. That's creative.""

""He never has to do it himself. Because he has a 'King Cobra' to take the chances for him,"" Jim replied. ""You on the other hand, never ask something of one of your team that you wouldn't do or haven't done yourself.""

""Neither would you."" He'd always liked that about Jim. He didn't demand the impossible, just that things be done right the first time. Gil leaned his chin on one hand. ""Did he explain why they called Will that?""

""Not in so many words."" The way he looked at Gil asked for the explanation though. ""You want to tell me?""

 

Jim should have guessed that if Gil were unwilling to explain, he wouldn't have brought it up. It was more reminiscing than he'd done",candidate00003
".

Inexorably my mind turned to the times I had encountered him before. Each time he had conspired not only to commit treason, but somehow to save lives. The notions were contradictory, but somehow appropriate. And true, I knew they were true regardless of the politics of it.  ""How did you meet him?"" There was no question who 'him' was.
 ""After I was... discharged from the Army, and I discovered what had happened to my sister in my absence, I made some reckless and foolish decisions."" He gave me a thin smile. ""I believed that making enough of a disturbance would draw attention to the problem. Unfortunately it drew only attention to myself. Sherlock, despite his own state saved me from some of the darker agents of the Crown. From that moment, I had a purpose."" 
Treason. And attempting to save people from the fate of his sister, as if what had happened to her could not be undone. ""And an ally. It's a shame you can't redeem yourself somehow. You're talented enough.""

""I am redeeming myself,"" he answered. ""In my eyes at least.  We are a conquered people. No, to them we are not even people, we are...livestock. I can speak the heresy without flinching now because I have seen the truth of it that they conceal many times over and with my death, I have made arrangements for evidence to find it's way to every major newspaper in the civilised world. If Rache is not dead, then perhaps I can leave him a legacy of revolution to return to.""

""To what end? When a herd goes mad, a smart farmer slaughters them."" Sebastian took a swig of his beer, and leaned back again. ""What does one do when the very air fights you? When they walk among us?""

""To find out how to fight them, you would have to wait for that publication,"" he said and exhaled. ""I would not create that level of risk without the possibility of success.""

No, perhaps he would not and it made me intrigued somehow when I had considered myself beyond curiosity. ""How will you know if anyone will act on it?"" I leaned forward, elbows on the table, and tracked the motion of his eyes with my own, looking for un-surety, darting.

""I do not. Every man works to his own conscience,"" he answered. ""Perhaps it will all be for nothing but I will have tried."" His gaze was steady and honest and filled with something I could not name. Regret perhaps, or a wistfulness that this was the way things were.

""You're afraid it won't work."" He wasn't, but I felt like challenging him. ""You should be there to see this through, but you don't want to see the consequences if it fails.""

""I'm not sure I want to see the consequences if it succeeds,"" he answered. ""And yourself, what is your history with Moriarty?""

""Medical discharge after Afghanistan. I shouldn't have survived at all. He needed… a foil more than someone to help with the price of the flat. We were a well matched fit, and after Victoria Gloriana healed my arm, it eased many of my concerns."" I had many doubts and fears and concerns, but I kept them close to my chest and had since my early days in the service.

""There are some of the Old Bloods who could do that,"" the doctor agreed. ""I was concerned he might try something similar again as to using you for expediency.""

""I suppose the opportunity never came up again."" I noted it wryly. ""We never spoke of it again, and he was forgiven for his failure. If I had known…"" I still cannot say if I would have gone along with it, but I felt the outrage and betrayal fresh in my heart reflecting on the memory.

""You should not have been in that position. Or what happened the last time we were here. He used you then to lure the Hound.""

I scoffed quietly, looking down at our empty plates, and hailed the barman for another round. ""I knew what I was doing with the Hound. I'd hunted foul creatures before my discharge, and I knew what baited them best.""

""It nearly had you,"" he reminded me. ""You were lucky.""  ""Luck had nothing to do with it. And your Rache, I'm sure he put you at risk for the cause."" It was hard to imagine that Rache had not been as obsessed as James had been in those last few weeks.

""Mmm."" His non-committal utterance was as much as a confirmation as I needed. It seemed both of us had issues with our companions. It was only after the drink had been brought and the other man had doggedly drunk down half of it that he said quietly. ""Did you love him?""

A more damning question had seldom been asked; still, for those who know me, and had known James, it",candidate00003
"hey, perhaps he'd like to test that authority out on him...

Well, that was an interesting thought right there.

Alistair lay back on his bedroll and drowsily fantasized. They were the last two, who better to turn to? He would broach the subject one night by the fire. Maybe he'd take him a rose. No, no he'd laugh. He didn't want people to laugh like that at him.

He didn't really expect to wake up to a dark shadow in the tent, darker than the dull dark of the campfire, a moving shadow, and he would've yelled -- loudly, in a manly fashion of course -- if there hadn't been a hand over his mouth.

There might have bit of a manly flail, because even when he realized who it was from the gleam of long blond hair and the exotic facial tattoos, this was not a particularly comforting thought. The Antivan was an assassin and this easy come easy go attitude to loyalty, it wasn't something he could get his head around. There was only one reason Zevran could have to be in his tent and that was to kill him!

""Shhh, shh, no need to cause a ruckus…"" Zevran was lying down on top of him, and oh god he was going to smother him.

""Mmph!"" Alistair managed which was actually in his head 'Zevran what by all the hells are you doing? Oh Maker, don't cut off anything I might need!'

""Shhhh. I only want to… test my skills."" He finally moved his hand off of Alistair's mouth.

""Pardon me if I don't find that particularly reassuring,"" Alistair hissed back in a bare whisper, ""Because last I heard your skills were as an  assassin.""

""Yes, and I pick locks as well. I have been thinking of your particular lock here. And can you blame me?"" It didn't surprise Alistair when Zevran put a hand over his groin.

""Oh, hey, whoa, well that's interesting."" He could throw Zevran, he out-massed him, but right now he was paralyzed by the touch over that area. ""Uh, you know, it's a magic lock and I know you keep telling everyone you've got magic fingers and, you know, offering back rubs and any type of rub you think you can get, but... Templar lock.""

""All the more reason I want to try to get through it,"" Zevran drawled. ""How long has it been, uhm?""

""How do you even know about it?"" Alistair asked belatedly. Zevran was fiddling with it. That caused all sorts of interesting sensations as the cage around his cock suddenly felt very constrictive and... nice.

""I've watched you. Luridly I might add. It's very easy, to watch you."" The edge of his mouth was curling up wickedly.

""Well watching is one thing and... Uh, what you're doing there is something else!"" Alistair's voice rose a little. ""You know, I do have my virtue and, well uh..."" It did seem a little ridiculous now he came to say it aloud.

""Your virtue. Yes, I have considered that. It would be an honor to take it from you."" Like his virginity was so much as picking a pocket!

""Yes, but..."" Alistair began. ""Do I get a choice in this? Or is this how you get your reputation? I thought you were too busy watching Wynne's bosom. You talk about it often enough. She must be three times your age and you're still flirting.""

""She's a very buxom woman,"" Zevran shrugged. ""Wise as well, and wise old buxom women still enjoy hearing that they have nice bosoms. Particularly when it's true."" In with the chatter, he was definitely stroking his hand around the magicked metal.

""Uh, look, not that what you're doing doesn't stir up some interest down there, but it's not comfortable interest and you can't break the lock. I'd rather not have a night of compressed balls, so..."" Alistair paused as he looked at what Zevran's fingers were actually doing. ""Wow, that's uh... well, how do your fingers move like that?

""Years of work. Excuse me, I have to see what I'm doing as well as feel it."" Then Zevran was sliding down his body and oh, his mouth was far too close to Alistair's trapped and now trying to get free cock.

This was pretty much what they had been completely forbidden to do. Messed with the training, the Templars said. Couldn't knock out a Mage's magic without it. No one had explained why and let's face it, he was a warrior now. Losing that ability didn't seem a bad trade from the way that Zevran was fondling his cock, pressing deep against the tight fitting cage. He wasn",candidate00003
"a madhouse, or still in the pits in Afghanistan. I leave that decision to you dear reader, as if you read this account, then surely I am real as the words on the page. The figure in the chair moved, a bare inclination of his head.

""Sebastian, I see I calculated your return correctly,"" he said and with those simple words my doubt was removed, but also the breath from my lungs as surely as if I had been struck. His eyes were bright, and glittering in the firelight and his mouth quirked in the manner that I instinctively knew meant to be his version of great humor, or perpetrating a wonderful jest.

My filthy pack was set on the ground and I have no recall of putting it there myself, nor of making any other sensible movement, though clearly I did these things unbidden by my conscious thoughts. ""How?"" It encompassed so many questions which danced in my mind.

""Calculating your return? A mere calculation of factors, and habits,"" James replied. “But of course you mean my presence. A mystery for the ages indeed. Some things are best left that way."" he said with infuriating evasiveness.

It was ever his way, and I wondered if it was due to the Queen's trust of him. Not out of reverence but out of wanting to keep a plaything alive.

 ""Are you...?"" Still human I wanted to ask though I don't know if he ever was on the same level as myself and other ordinary folk.

""Intact? Yes."" It was not an answer to the question I wanted to ask but it sufficed. 

It encapsulated the major concerns, though I was not sure intact mattered much when it came to them. I edged nearer, willing my knees to bend and feet to lift, finally close enough to touch his shoulder, seeking body heat as proof.

He was solid, real and he turned his head to meet my gaze and for the briefest moment I was convinced I saw an iridescence much like light on the carapace of a beetle shimmer over the black center of his eye.  James was returned but not unchanged unless it was my own mind giving me visions.

""I am real Sebastian, and I might be somewhat changed, but I am still your companion James Moriarty.""

""I know what they did to me. I've seen what happened to other soldiers."" Gibbering didn't always mean a ruined mind from my experience but sometimes something possessed by horror. Sometimes I'd suspected that something of the others, of royalty, had come back in the person and been incapable of using the body appropriately.

He looked at me for a long moment. ""Their realm breaks the ordinary mind Sebastian. Perhaps it is to that you owe your survival as you are far beyond the normal soldier. I attribute my own survival to my extraordinary mind. There is so much I know now Sebastian, so much!"" His face was paled and his eyes burned fanatically in darkened sockets, but I had seen him that way many times when upon a case and to my shame, the shock of his presence blinded me to some of the signs.

Here was a dead man sitting in front of me, animated and speaking, his physical mannerisms as they had ever seemed to be. ""Do you know what is going on here?”

""Yes. And it is far bigger than you can comprehend Sebastian,"" he replied. ""Sit, you are quite pale with shock.""

It was odd for him to attempt to comfort me, after all over a year missing. ""I've been out there killing these things as they encroach on us,"" I countered, because just then I needed no tender ministrations. I needed physical proof, I needed to be surer of what was before my eyes, and what my ears were hearing.

""Then tell me what you have surmised so far,"" he said gesturing again to the chair opposite him.

Reluctantly I took my place across from him, watching his eyes all the while. ""Royals not our own are encroaching on our lands. Known ones, named ones that have been foretold of in ancient histories. The King in Yellow is dead, as are more, acts sanctioned by Victoria herself.""

It was a simple way to describe the events, but accurate in my opinion.

""Indeed. And like the proverbial tip of the tentacle, that is all we see,"" James said. He leaned forward. ""Now imagine if you can how the Royals and the Sleeping Ones truly go to war. This is but the opening arguments, your previous wars a spillover of discontent from That Place to here.""

Truly, the suggestion changed nothing of my outlook -- as a soldier and a patriot. ""And?""

""Before we have been toys and playthings. Insignificant or cherished pets at best. Now we have proven a threat. Victoria Gloriana rises meteoric and old alliances shift and collapse, feeding grounds move and with it treaties crumble,"" James recited it with an edge in his voice, hysteria or mania I did not know, all the more chilling for his calm. ""War comes to Albion on",candidate00003
"form of charm.

Someone from before, old memories, times he had yielded back to their keepers, their holders, until he had been free again. It threatened to weigh on him, but he leaned in, keeping a hand on the edge and a close balance of himself as he put his face through the gate.

""Now that..."" a voice said that he recognized all too well. ""...took even less time than I thought. You must be bored Lucifer.""

A figure, a being coalesced together, coming to a point of existence not far in front of him.

""That depends on your perception of time."" Not standing outside of creation, but within it. His coup, in so many ways, the creator at once beyond and simultaneously less than his Father. ""You called me.""

""Yeah."" Elaine stood there, wearing the same form as he remembered before she had become God. ""I thought I would see how you are doing out here swimming around in the primordial soup.""

He slipped through a little further, perched between the void and her side of the gate, her creation. ""Swimmingly. And you, creator?"" Part of him hoped that she held true to what she has learned, still, though he did not know how much 'time' had passed.

There was just a moment of expression in her eyes that he recognized from the days when things had been so simple and she had just been a girl accidentally getting involved with him for simple reasons. ""That's a bit formal. I still think of myself as Elaine.""

He contemplated his words, because the heaviness of lack of time was on his side, watching her expression. She, too, had experienced the slowing of it, and the pulls and sharp tugs at the same time. He wondered what it felt like for the endless to traipse through her being, her creation. That was a question he'd never had answered. ""Good. It suits you.""

""I have to have something that is just me,"" Elaine said with a faint smile.  She remained loitering on the threshold with him. ""Look at you. How have you been?""

Like a doting family member. ""Traveling. Seeing what there is to see.""

""And what is there to see in the Void?"" she asked. He could feel the sharp vibrancy of existence wrapped around her.

Like a living thing, completely interwoven with her. She embraced that power, in a way Michael had long abandoned. He let the sensation wash over him, let it tingle his senses in a way emptiness hadn't. ""Nothing.""

""Mmm. Have you had your fill of emptiness?"" she said with a hint of wry irony.

 He made a noncommittal noise as he leaned slightly further into her creation. ""The grass is greener."" He had forgotten the intensity of things rather than the half formed potentialities. There were things out there that moved in the darkness. Strange things, the nightmares of insane gods, the ruins of universes abandoned to the gnawing parasites of entropic heat death.

He had looked and stopped and observed and let it pass, let it all pass, or they had let him pass, and that was the question. What next and what now, and the dizzying sensation of a familiar creation curling at the edges of his senses. ""I would be an aberration to your creation.""

She looked at him with those eyes there were at once the creators' and that of the twelve year old girl who had accidentally summoned the Devil. ""No, you wouldn't,"" she said simply. ""How could you be?""

There was no role for him to fill, for he had passed those burdens on to better actors. It was a freedom, in its own way, to be beyond those stages and requirements. ""That is perhaps a question you don't want to ask.""

""I do and I have,"" Elaine asked and smiled.""You are always welcome in this creation. You are no aberration Lucifer.""

He had watched it unfold from a position, if not the exact time, and felt the tug of experience, memories and past which he had not been willing to yield to his father. The scar was his, his past, his decisions, still his. ""I will leave again, after a while."" He kept a hand on the edge of the door, but curiosity beckoned him further.

""You think someone always has an ulterior motive don't you?"" Elaine said by way of an answer. ""Plans within plans, within ever convoluted plans.""

What he had learned  from Yahweh, his Father. From his brother.

He felt the smile touch his face as he looked out across her creation, and then to her again. ""Perhaps, perhaps not. Perhaps I know I will be restless again.""

""That's okay,"" she said. ""I just wanted you to know you have a Home."" Such a simple innocent powerful statement. Even his own Creation had not truly felt like home. He had never been entirely sure why.

Perhaps because of schemes and plans",candidate00003
"ll turn up here again, okay?""

""Got it, Dad. I promise to stay in touch."" Greg hesitated as they reached the doorway even as his mother moved forward to hug him and kiss him. The flinch was hidden this time and he managed to accept her contact and concern.

""Take care of yourself, Greg, sweetie,"" she said as she straightened up. ""And of Gil, too.""

Greg nodded. ""That we definitely agree on.""

""It was good to meet you both, though I wish it hadn't been under these circumstances."" Gil stood up, shadowing Greg to the door before he offered both of them a hand shake.

Pete shook his hand with a firm grip, and Rane treated him to a hug as well much to everyone's astonishment. 

""You make sure you take care of yourself as well, Gil,"" she said even as she stepped back. ""You've got our numbers, Greg's got our e-mail. You let us know anything.""

""We will."" Gil wasn't quite sure what 'anything' entailed, but it sounded like she wanted to hear any news, good or bad. Gil stepped back to stand beside Greg in the doorway. ""Have a safe trip back home.""

The watched as Greg's parents left, Greg finally pushing the door shut as their car pulled away.

""I shouldn't be glad they're gone but... Jesus, I don't think I could deal with them being around. Congratulations, Gil, you've survived a visit from my mother.""

There was something about the tone of Greg's voice, something about the texture of his words, and while Gil couldn't pick up what it was, he could tell it was there. He shifted closer, slid an arm over Greg's shoulder and then slowly, a little awkwardly embraced him. ""So did you.""

Greg turned into him and leaned, ""She doesn't mean it. She never means it. She just has this uncanny way of saying exactly the wrong thing..."" he mumbled into him. ""Usually it doesn't matter, I don't care but... oh god, Gil, do you think the same? That it's like me raping you, having my child forced on you?""

The leaning felt good, and he could feel Greg's words more than he heard them. He moved fingers, a little awkward still, and rubbed down Greg's back. ""No. I'm... grateful that it is yours, actually. That it wasn't one of them. If they hadn't kept saying that it was yours, I...""

Greg was holding him as well and he could feel as well as hear the sigh of relief at that. ""We were a good match, they said. I... god, it wears me out dealing with Mom. I love her and Dad, but even at the best of times, I spend forever afterwards as some sort of wreck. You were great. And I'm really glad you weren't horrified at the thought it was mine.""

The thought that it was there at all was so much more pressing than worrying over whose it was, but Gil didn't say that. He just nodded, and finally started to back up towards the sofa. ""You're smart, bright, and ambitious, you like to learn, and you worry about people. You'll make a good father."" A better father than Gil himself, but there wasn't any sense in saying that, either

""So will you,"" Greg said as he eventually sat on the couch. He looked directly at Grissom. ""You're not going to leave this all to me, you know."" He smiled a little at him but his expression was worried and more than a little serious.

""I hope not,"" Gil shrugged casually, one arm still around Greg as they settled down, side-by-side, leg against leg. ""I just... the way you've reacted helps me. I'm glad you came here.""

""Even with the woods rescue and the parents from hell?"" Greg grinned a little. ""Well, with any luck, we got my obstacles out of the way, so we get to concentrate on you now.""

If Greg thought they were going to deal with just one person at a time, he was insane. Gil leaned in a little more, peering at Greg's shifting eye movements. ""We can both concentrate on getting better and coping.""

""You get closer, Griss, and I might just have to kiss you again,"" Greg said almost nervously. ""It's like a reaction I have.""

""Closeness bringing about some strange kissing reaction?"" Gil didn't move, shift forward or backwards. ""We could test it scientifically, but I'm not sure what the control would be.""

Greg shifted just a little closer to him. ""Tell me no and I'll back off,"" he said",candidate00003
"approached me now.

""I  would not take arms against you, son of Arathorn,"" I told him quietly  when he had at last stopped several feet beyond my spot. ""My enemy is  but the Eye, within its cold Tower, and those who serve beneath him be  it willingly or otherwise at this point. If you think it wise to draw  Andúril against me I will not oppose it, and indeed I would welcome the  touch of that legendary blade if it were otherwise so presented."" I said  quietly and firmly.

Our eyes looked upon one another and the  connection of a Soul Gaze established itself- only to be reflected, cast  aside and denied by some inner will and wellspring of strength he  possessed- no doubt the fortitude that had allowed him to throw aside  Sauron's black will when he looked upon the Palantir properly some weeks  from now.

He drew the hilt out a few inches without flinching,  though I couldn't exactly say the same, as I blinked and leaned back in  surprise; it felt like the utter denial that the Guardian Angel serving  beneath Uriel had performed, when I chose to see it with my Wizards  Sight.

""You may have tried to conquer my spirit, Istari,""  he stated softly as the blade rose further still, ""but I have taken it  unto myself and reversed your spell; and lo! I have seen some glimpse of  what you are, and of what you represent. You are not of Arda, not  wholly, and nor would I claim you to be that which you state; but I have  seen the Vala you proclaim and in him is the fire of Ilúvatar. To what  reasons you have come are not clear to me- but I am assuaged of your  intentions to aide the Fellowship,"" he said slowly.

I exhaled in  relief and smiled loosely before he drew the sword in full, and Andúril  sliced a thin line across my left cheek while my guard was down. I  hissed lowly as the absurdly sharp edge bit through my gathered flesh  and spilled faint dews of blood across the grass.

He stared a  moment more before sheathing his sword and leaning down, gripping my  right hand and drawing me back to my feet. ""Rise, Dresden the Black,"" he  intoned. I gripped my staff and drew it upright as well, recognizing  the reason for his action even if it burned irritably, and I shuffled my  staff to the crook of one elbow so that I could press the same hand  against my cheek.

""Look and see, my companions! This battle has  been fought and the stranger bleeds as truly as you and I, were we dealt  such a cut. What suspicions as I held are allayed at this moment, and I  ask that you as well set them aside ere we go forward."" Aragorn called  back to the other two.

End of Chapter Two.

Things become tenser still between Dresden the Black and the Fellowship.

Boromir stood firm as Aragorn and I approached, suspicion not only present in the hard lines of his face, but outright scorn. ""Hail I say to you, son of Denethor and Glóin, thrice and for all this morrow,"" I said at once, lingering not long upon the man's distrust for instead I felt it right to kneel and present myself for the dwarf's approval.

Boromir could be checked by the Dunedain at my side, and they had passed through Gimli's long forsaken homeland only to find it in ruination and flame, host to an evil that few are aware of in modern times. An injustice if ever there were one, and Gandalf had given his life to see the Fellowship to safety. For that alone I could not hold myself back.

""To what fate has done to you and yours in Moria long behind, I offer condolences and more, for I have it not only in my power to fix, mayhap, but only the pressing matter of time that denies my offer to you now."" Gimli's stony features could have chiseled yet further, almost to match the man beside him, and I spoke thus, ""Yet when we've the freedom, when this journey has seen itself through to the very end, I offer you my aide as Istari in this further venture, son of Glóin: Moria shall be renewed. If it does not gleam as the white walls of the White City, I offer you my staff and knowledge to make it so ere I wander back from Arda, be thus in yonder months or many years. Your home shall be renewed!""

I could but feel the sneer which graced good Boromir's expression next. Indeed, his words were not to be unexpected, given such a vast and terrible claim. I might of as well have sworn to march forward into Mordor and tear down the black tower of Barad-dur with my own hands.

""For pity's sake,"" he exclaimed, ""do you not see the silver tongue that flashes in the light? Do you not hear the honeyed lies clear as this winding horn I carry?""

Gimli met my gaze without flinching. He buried his axe in the ground between us with a mighty huff. ""How my heart longs for",candidate00004
"meter in just seconds. In under a minute he stepped back from an arching tent as tall as he and just as wide as their camels meandering nearby.

""Ladies first.""

He gestured her in with a hand on the opening, pulling back the thick fold. Miss Carnahan peered in warily. The next moment she made a little noise of delight mixed with wonder in the back of her throat that did very interesting things for his libido, though he squashed the initial stirring before it bloomed into something harder to wrangle under control.

""As I said, ma'am, more than enough rooms, and all the comforts I pegged you for needing, full bedroom and bath, stocked kitchen, even a small library next to the common room to help with your inquiries. Unfortunately no wireless seems to pick up a signal where we'll be going in the weeks ahead, if my experiences in deserts and old magic are anything to go by.""

He let her enter and stepped back, fiddling with his satchel of ropes dumped carelessly to the sand. While far more simple he had no need to enjoy the luxury or accommodations of a team-class dwelling. She poked her head back out to stare at him with a good deal less animosity. ""Aren't you coming in?"" she asked.

""No ma'am. Wouldn't want the crew to get suspicious,"" he said good-naturedly. Then he tugged a rope end and his workman's tent began compiling like a set of dominoes falling into place, popping into position at knee-height. Unlike her own, his truly was a simple thing, only a little wider within than the size without. He shrugged his way in and sighed when his head met the make-due pillow of a rolled up rug.

He heard her footsteps coming around the end and then she was kneeling by his boots and looking at him incredulously. ""Surely you cannot be comfortable in that, Mr. Weasley.""

He yawned behind one hand. ""If I worried about comfort, Miss Carnahan, I wouldn't be a curse breaker. Don't forget to zip the opening before you turn in. Good morning."" He tucked his feet in and toed the opening closed before her nose, letting his mind drift to a place of quiet contemplation.

""Ooh!"" Her protest brought a rough grin to his lips.

Their journey ticked by on the calendars kept by Bill and the leading goblin, Cthukuk, who finally deigned to speak with him on the eighth night. Unfortunately for them both, that happened to be the point by which he'd put together a reasonable understanding of where and when his life, and by association Miss Carnahan's, would be forfeit; when they finally closed toward her fabled Hamunaptra. And the stars in conjunction with the analysis of her map were leading them fairly true.

""We are nearing, wizard.""

Cthukuk's voice in English felt as comforting as a Banshee's opening wail. Given his run in with two over the course of his life to date, and Fleur in full-on Veela wrath did not count, Bill resisted the urge to wince with a surprising degree of success.

""I was beginning to think the same,"" he answered obliquely.

Cthukuk gave him no other warning. No sinister, premeditated chuckle. No whistle to coordinate with the others nearby. Not even the swish of a hitherto-concealed dagger rising from the folds of a thrown-back cloak. The goblin simply pointed and the rune-encrusted rings around his swollen index finger spat a wave of invisible force against the body of Hannibal, his camel.

Bill had known to expect something, but kinetic energy was not one of the areas he had prepared for. Hannibal went down in an explosion of blood and fur, sending Bill himself into a headlong tumble that he barely turned into a halted roll back toward his beloved mount for a fraction of protection.

Nearby Miss Carnahan screamed. The other goblins split their numbers, two more encircling his position to flank him, the remainder going after her. In an instant a sense of protective duty reared up inside of his admittedly shaken head.


Bugger this!


A thin brass flute materialized in Bill's right hand, loosened from the holster around his upper arm. There was barely enough time to raise it to his lips, and even before he made contact with the tip he was breathing out in a seemingly nonsensical rush. The first silver rings surrounding him hummed as a volley of force raced forward, throwing bits of camel and desert sands skyward. Then a piercing wail rose up on the wind from every corner at once, a tone of deafening, all-pervading volume that burrowed into the ears and set up an amphitheater with no way out. The goblins by instinctive nature snarled in Gobbledygook and clapped their burnished fingers against their ears, while beneath them the orcneas bellowed as if being slaughtered, thrashing their leathery heads from side to side; thick spurts of metallic green blood splashed across the desert floor. Gone insensate with pain the mad mounts charged head-long into each other, crazed with agony.

"they were behaving like good little servants to Mab's ironclad-will compared to that?
Hindsight response; it matters a whole damn lot, that's what.
She made her move while I was still at the 'dribble soup across my chest unless told to close my mouth and swallow' stage. Normally arctic shades of blue, green, and piercing violet were whitewashed to a nondescript flat tone throughout her hair, itself unbraided and laying lifeless around her brow and neck in a way that, even had I retained my full senses, I would have been hard-pressed to guess was the Winter Lady, the Queen-in-the-making, Maeve.
I still remember the first thing that caught my attention beyond the usual and tried to warn me away from what was to come - her eyes. Carefully concealed behind that don't-look-at-me hairdo until the door closed with all the finality of the headsman's axe. Then she tilted her head back to peer at me, with eyes that glittered of delicious satisfaction, the huntress cornering the wounded prey - in fact, no, even that does not convey the measure of her gaze upon my form in proper truth. I'm being far too generous to my own unstable position back then.
Her look said, in no uncertain terms, that I was a drowning man half-way down the whirlpool, clinging desperately to a strip of wood as the sky roared with thunder and sleet and the waves crashed down relentlessly from above. And she was just the latest force of unforgiving nature falling from on high to snuff my pitiful existence from the world. It said I was a dead man no matter what happened next, coasting along on borrowed time before the inevitable end, and that I could choose to let go and be dragged down by the current or smashed to tinder like the driftwood holding me afloat.
And would you like to know what I did in response to that deadly gaze? I'd love to say I sat up straight, gave her the finger, and vanished back to Chicago with a well-placed aparturum and witty remark to remember me by. I'm sure some part of my brain was desperately firing on all cylinders with the explicit orders to do just that, which turned to frothing at the metaphorical mouth as I just lay there paralyzed with cold terror instead.
My tongue went drier than it already had been. A vicious sweat broke out across my forehead and palms, hair standing on edge from the neck down, and my breath came in slow and painfully clenched exertions.
""Oh, my Knight,"" she cooed in a mocking tribute to Mab, ""my poor, poor Knight, whatever shall you do?"" She strode forward and laid the platter with my chicken broth to one side of the bed, stretched out a section of sheet beside my left hip, and sat down rather more primly than her attitude and look promised she could do. I flinched just from proximity to her and those unrelenting eyes.
""Why ever do you tremble so?"" she asked in a sort of sing-song tone perfectly at odds with her expression.
When I did not answer Maeve reached out to the bowl and swept a spoonful up to her own lips, which parted just enough to take the fluid in, and then without swallowing or spilling a drop she leaned forward to press them against my own. A shudder of pure chill raced down my body from the point of contact straight to my toes, plush though those lips were against my own courser finish. Her tongue darted out to part mine and in a disgusting take on the French kiss, or maybe the snowball depending on your savviness, she tilted her head down enough to pass the now-cold broth between us in one slow motion. Her tongue roved out and wrestled mine down with no effort until the last transfer of fluids was completed.
I felt the quirk in her mouth as she smiled and pulled back, one hand rising to swipe away the trail of saliva cooling into frost between our mouths, the other coming up beneath my chin to close my mouth before I dribbled across the sheets.
""Swallow."" She ordered without a trace of her former pleasant tones.
I swallowed, and even had the good sense to open again without being told. I couldn't tell why she was doing this, but looking back I recognize how much satisfaction she was reaping from the oral rape.
She repeated the process once, twice, thirty times. However many it took to empty the bowl, and all the while the only thing I felt was terrified urges to obey and please the inhuman thing before me. The clamor that had erupted across my flesh at her presence had since gone on to leave me shivering from the lump of half-frozen soup sluicing back and forth in my gut.
""Mm, so cold. We mustn't let the Winter Knight freeze to death."" She pressed me down into the bedding and for a long moment I feared she would climb atop and smother me. Instead she drew the blankets up to my chin and used that as an excuse to lean in and press her",candidate00004
".

The Third righted that matter with the end of a rigid pole. Just as two months earlier, lighting his pipe so quickly that Naruto could not even read the hand seals, so too did the Hokage move like the wind in striking down each remaining Iwa-nin that closed in on them, smashing the bodies to the ground only to fling them skyward the next instant in a blur of precision. In a handful of beats sixteen men came crashing to the hard land, unconscious.

The last, the commander of the strike team, watched from a measured distance. ""Iwa remembers,"" he bit out hotly, and before the stretching staff could reach him, the man leveled the earth upwards beneath their feet and the wagon where the Third and the merchant stood, and then he was gone underground.

In the aftermath of the surprise assault, the Third sent his walking, talking staff to finish bringing the scroll merchant on into Iwa proper, and issued a return to Konoha for the rest of them while the evening hours still burned red on the horizon. Naruto complained loudly about being sent home without seeing the mission through to its completion, but he quelled soon enough before the Third's stare.

""'least we got to use our kenjutsu sommat,"" he muttered under his breath to his teammates. Kiba was less enthused, but it was Ino who seemed to be downright shaken by her contributions in the act of death. Naruto could, for once, sympathize. Mizuki's demise had not been a pleasant introduction to the real side of the ninja arts awaiting them down the road.

They reached the gates of Konoha by sunrise of the second morning following the incident. Unknown to his students, the Third Hokage had sat watch while they slept fitfully each time they bedded down for the night, thoughts too full to sleep even had he not been intent on seeing Team Sarutobi returned to Konoha safely.

Naruto frowned. ""So what do we do in the meanwhile?""

""What else? Train. There's no guarantee anyone will be nominated.""

And on that ominous note, one week later, the same Jōnin came around to break the news; ""Sorry to say it, but Lord Hokage can not in good faith nominate Team Sarutobi for this year's Chuunin Exams. Better luck next time.""

A cold stone sank down Naruto's gullet and settled into place amidst his ramen noodles. Kiba and Akamaru pitched a fit, complaining about the man hours spent working together for nothing this year, while Ino rolled her eyes and left without a word.

""But… but we worked so hard!"" Naruto finally said to the silver haired man. ""We even fought off those Iwa shinobi! The Old Man's been drilling us fiercely for over two months! What more does he want?""

The Jōnin stared at him with a curious expression. ""Sometimes your skill and dedication just aren't enough to cut it, kid. Lord Hokage's decision is final. There's always next year.""

Below, Sasuke, of course, because who else but the prestigious bastard of the Uchiha clan, was fighting another genin from Suna and holding his own against the barrage of sand attacks.

Naruto squinted at his Academy rival and secretly hoped to see him beaten to a bloody pulp, but what were the odds of that actually happening? So far, slim to none. Red eyes aglow, Sasuke was countering every attack thrown his way, and landing a handful of his own in retribution.

After twenty minutes Naruto gave up and stood up, working back from the crowd into the rest of the Academy and then into the village center. I could really go for about ten bowls of Teuchi's tastiest, spiciest ramen right now, he lamented. I'll even settle for the fish roe ramen.

He never got the chance.

The village lit up like a bonfire, as throughout, ten infiltrators set into motion Konoha's destruction and the taking of the hidden beasts pooled together.

""Naruto!"" Ino was the first to reach him after the explosions stopped, finding the other blond half buried in a pile of debris. Naruto grunted as he crawled out from beneath a shattered wall, bleeding from half a dozen small but irritable wounds. He wiped a torn sleeve across his brow and held his arm there to stem the flow from reaching his eyes.

""Oh kami, Naruto, it's awful! We need to find Kiba!""

""What the hell happened?""

""I don't know!""

A man stepped out from the shadows behind them, an older, harrowed, sterner copy of Sasuke. Naruto stared at him blankly, briefly wondering how the bastard had grown over a foot and when did his Sharingan start bleeding from the tear ducts, when the longest three days of the young ninja's life came crashing down upon him in a reign of horrible fire and memories of torture, the Iwa battle gone catastrophically wrong.

Ino screamed when her teammate collapsed bonelessly, shivering, to the ground. When the darker Sasuke turned his bleeding gaze upon her she hit him with all the oomph of her Shintenshin no Jutsu",candidate00004
"a double handful of ash and nearly dead embers from the silent fireplace burned to its last, and set it down atop the girl's bedding. The sparks leapt and fell with only a bit of encouragement from his breath. In no time at all a crackling flame danced wickedly about the surface and spread toward whatsoever it could find.

Satisfied that the room would soon be in cinders, he checked to be sure the boy was still alive. Tiny lungs drew in breath and expelled it, even as the eyes were shut tight. He ripped a long strip from the girl's skirt and wrapped the last Potter heir in it rather than keep the old banner, then placed the tiny boy into a fold sewn into his cloak near the back. It was already filled with small ointments to slow blood loss and sooth pain, but as he had no need of such yet, he dumped them out upon the table to make room. The boy fit just-so inside.

""This will be a hard life, child. I hope for both our sakes that I can lie as well as I think I can."" The smoke filling the space began to make it hard to breath as it doubled back upon itself, and so he wrenched open the door again, paused to throw his now-useless ointments upon the blaze, and stepped out into a new future, for House Black as well as House Potter.

The son of a Ser.


Harry


""Come, lad, at it again!"" Harry Rivers scrambled off his wet arse before his Lord Father had even finished the taunt, hastening across the slippery slope to reclaim his hunting dagger from the shallowest stretch of riverbed. It was a small thing by the measure of full-grown men, but for a youth of just eight, it fit his palms and then some so that he had to grip it as if it were a bastard sword. Which was fitting, for he himself was a bastard.

But no such blade could claim to be even half as fine as his dagger, with its rich wine red-entwining-green leather wrapped hilt and polished, now gleaming silvered-red blade free of blemishes, untarnished despite the months of training, and a firm edge along each side perfect for peeling back fur and hide that narrowed to a wicked point well suited to stabbing. The Old Magic had tempered it long ago, according to his Lord Father, which was the only reason why he allowed the grip to hold onto the traitorous colors of House Potter alongside the velvet black-green of House Gaunt. That lustrous leather lay damp and cool from the latest bath in the stream. Harry squeezed tight, and fat droplets of water oozed out from between his fingertips to splash around his sopping wet boots.

Satisfied it wouldn't turn in his hands, Harry launched himself around the river stones of his name with a cry of determination.

Ser Sirius Black, aged eight-and-twenty, eyed the boy charging him with splashing footfalls and nimbly stepped back without a glance to the treacherous rocks passing beneath his own boot soles, smoothing down the front of his ragged shirt and yawning widely in dismissal. The long black and blunted training blade clutched in his off-hand dipped and rose with the motion.

Harry's own muddled green eyes dilated, widening at first by the casual disregard, narrowing the next beat with renewed vigor. Even so as he hopped quickly amidst the deepening pool and pull of the stream he had to turn his gaze upon each step in his way to be sure he didn't slip or turn an ankle in the numerous faults lurking beneath the surface. It had taken him two weeks to recover from the swelling the last time, to no end of mockery in the interim by his Uncle Regulus.

""I haven't all day, you know.""

Harry finally reached his Lord Father and swung widely upward, aiming for the shins or, better yet, the thighs. He couldn't yet reach the belly and he knew better than to aim for the manhood. It wasn't his place to",candidate00004
"you.

Slowly coming up to my feet, I leveled him a wary look and opened my mouth to respond. ""I'm listening. What do you want?""

I'd have phrased it nicer, but who am I kidding; I could sooner keep the insolence from my tone as the moon could refuse to rise every evening.

Khronos spared me a bland look and motioned one hand around himself slowly, and then arched an eyebrow, as if saying Out here? Are you serious?

""Yessir I am. You do not have my permission to cross my threshold until I've heard, in normal human octaves, exactly what it is that you are expecting me to perform for you yourself."" I answered his unspoken question without a drop of sarcasm- guess the moon won't be rising tonight, after all.

Something inhuman passed across his features, a flat, dark look, seeming to reshape how his face molded together.

Then it was gone and he stepped forward and across my threshold as if it was nonexistent. And it most assuredly was not, given all of the hours and days I had toiled to make sure this place was as much a home in the proper sense as any other in the world.

""Mister Dresden, despite my name and its role in history, I do not have unlimited time at my side to spare with fencing words at one another like this. The window to interfere grows smaller with every minute of time that passes forward. Do you understand me?"" He asked sharply.

I narrowed my eyes at his own tone. ""What do you want?"" I repeated.

One hand clenched into a fist, but he pressed his emotions back down under the mask he wore, and with a gesture the door at his back slammed closed again. With that done Khronos stared back at me with those too-wide pupils for several seconds, as if weighing his words before delivering them.

""As you are well aware, their is no law prohibiting transition throughout the flow of time. It is, I believe your kind views, a task deemed more or less futile due to the weight and speed with which the current runs. You would need a significant degree of opposite and surpassing strength to wade through it.""

I nodded once. A mortal wizard could, at best, and at the risk of burning their life out for it as all too many hopeless schmucks had proven throughout history, make a localized journey backwards or forwards in time to within about fifteen minutes, provided you had enough juice built up to draw upon.

It took less to speed your perception of time up or slow it down rather than try to overcome it altogether, but I could manage a jump to within a few minutes, provided Demonreach was willing to comply and supply the necessary oomph.

""Unlike you mortals, our kind have a firmer understanding. My brethren and I are more than capable of sundering the current flow and forcing it unto a separate path- which we have already done all too often. Do you understand?"" He asked.

""No."" I answered simply. His face flitted through that dark, subhuman expression again, but Mouse let out a low growl in the back of his throat, and the deity's eyes locked onto my Foo dog's for a long moment.

Then he exhaled tiredly and leaned against the steel door. I frowned.

""Say that you and yours decided to divert a river, and your first decision is to create a dam to block it. The river is soon caught up and overflowing, if done improperly, and spills back along the way that it came to some degree. Drainage ditches are created to divert some of the river aside, but a lack of attention insures that the ditch is filled to the brim before it is ready, and soon runs freely over the lay of the land. Before you can stop it, the land is flooded, taking with it so many lives, and the only choice is to destroy what is built of the dam to return the river to its natural course in the hope of releasing the land of its damage. To some degree the flood has already reentered into the empty river bed, but as the water level slowly diminishes, pockets and pools and even perhaps a lake or two are left standing behind, alone, separated. Due to the casualties already sustained, you lack the necessary force to remove these unsightly and wasteful pools, and over time, they stagnate and decay, and disease accumulates within them that spreads to the surrounding area.""

Khronos managed to say all of that without once needing to stop and breath, and I gaped at him, even as my mind processed his message and the underlying point. After a few seconds I got it. ""You're saying that time has been broken up like that?"" I asked him.

The deity nodded. ""I am alone among my kind these days, Harry Dresden. There is little enough that I may do about this as such, though I may still step upon the surface of time and trek back and forth as an observer.""

""So what happens when a..."" I struggled to wrap my",candidate00004
"the kind of salary those terms said he was willing to pay me to sign up as his hit-wizard.

Oh, I had no illusions as to what he really wanted my more-than-marginal talents for, but the contract laying there was quite circumspect in the wording.

And outside of that one little flaw, I'll admit that it felt pretty damn good thinking of what my life could be like in the nominal hours.

And yet, for every pro that I could find, the cons that came with being an wizard in this century knocked them back down a few pegs; what good was a fancier apartment or, more than likely, an actual house, if I'd just burn out the water heater and electrical systems within a day?

What could I do with a better mode of transportation if it would just breakdown and cost me a small fortune to repair? The Blue Beetle was slow and my god, was it an embarrassment to drive around in, but I could reasonably rely on it to get me there on time when it counted for what for.

No. Housing and transportation were non-factors in this equation, and the only things I could measure the potential deal in the making by were the other aspects of my life that could be impacted.

My reputation with Chicago PD's Special Investigations unit wasn't at an all time high at the moment, and what little I had regained since the Sells' incident wasn't enough to mend the fence with Karrin Murphy, which meant that I wasn't going to be looking to them for a case and the usual exorbitant-per-hour quota I used to get for my services semi-frequently.

Without that, I was already past-due on this month's rent, to say nothing of the next month's.

But even still, I could probably scrounge up something from somewhere to get through by the skin of my teeth, just as I had in the days before becoming SI's consultant.

What ultimately changed my mind about immediately rejecting Marcone's deal and telling him to shove it was the effect his name carried with it in spoken circles.

When news spread that Gentleman Johnny Marcone was coming through a section of Chicago, the rest of the criminals with two braincells to rub together took their illegal activities to another section of the town, and though I hated to admit it, he wielded his considerable political clout like a surgeon would a scalpel; in four years, he had never been successfully charged with a single case in court.

Was he innocent? Define 'innocent' in full legalese and hope your lawyer happens to speak as fluently in bullshido.

As for anyone else that was stupid enough to hang around and try to duke it out with him outside of the courts, they usually found out why Marcone had won out over the Jamaicans and Vargassi family those four years ago.

The name 'Harry Dresden', on the other hand, was typically accompanied with skeptic stares and unpleasant muttering about my hourly rates, even when I provided the services agreed to by those desperate enough to ask for my help.

And dammit if that doesn't grate on my nerves more than almost anything else in the world.

I'm trying to save lives and help the little guy out along the way, but most of the time, the little guy is too busy adamantly refusing to acknowledge reality until it takes a bite out of their head one midnight stroll to offer even common courtesy.

And that wasn't even accounting for the vast opinion of the White Council.

Even now, with the Doom of Damocles lifted at last and by their own reluctant order, I was viewed my many of my fellow and older council-members as a danger to the Council's reputation at the best of times, and a volatile threat at the worst.

Exhaling, I nodded my head.

I wouldn't sign up to help Johnny Marcone under normal circumstances.

I wouldn't want to disappoint my teacher or the views of magic he had instilled in me after helping to spare my life about a seven or eight years ago.

But there were times when he had mentioned the lesser of two evils, and if Marcone didn't put me on the tab now, than who would he turn to next?

I knew enough wizards of the White Council to know that none of them would agree, and nor would they take kindly to his trying.

More likely, he'd find another Victor Sells somewhere, easily lured in by the money and having no compunctions whatsoever about murder, and then I'd be up to my neck in bloodshed that I could have avoided.

I picked up the sheet of fine paper and scanned the terms printed there again, frowning at the lack of casual-loopholes, and picking up the pen, I scratched through two or three lines I found unappealing before setting the sheet back down and facing him.

Marcone examined them and sighed quietly beneath his breath. ""I had wondered if you would even understand the meaning behind those words, Mister Dresden,"" he said with a light condescension in his tone.

I scowled",candidate00004
"But that doesn't mean we're not friends.""

Stein couldn't stop the answering smile that stretched across his mouth. Even weighted down by the dark thoughts that twisted through his mind like barbed wire, he couldn't fail to appreciate the rare times Spirit cast aside his outrageous behavior to reveal a far more serious nature.

Probably one of the reasons Stein had enjoyed cutting into him so much. It had become an obsession the first time he'd glimpsed the steel lurking behind warm green eyes. Stein had seen the blade that Spirit would become. Bright and sharp, slicing through flesh and stone with no hesitation, with a speed so great as to steal away any pain the blow would have brought. Merciless compassion wrapped in smiles and crying fits that had left Stein baffled even as he hungered for more.

The desire to see beneath the flesh had consumed him. Night after night he would slice into soft skin, searching, always searching for the strength that reflected the strong curve of a scythe.

Stein's eyes slid closed as the Kishin Madness seized those memories, giving them depth and substance until he could smell the copper sweetness of blood, feel Spirit's warm skin beneath his hand as he guided the scalpel. He closed his eyes but that didn't stop him from seeing the way blood gathered as the flesh yielded beneath a razor sharp point.

""Friends."" Stein's voice was rough, with desire or fear even he couldn't say. ""Yes, I do believe we are friends."" Friends did not slice through the skin in order to explore the vulnerable insides it protected. They did not feel another's strength like a siren call and hunger to explore how far it could be pressed before splintering beneath the strain.

""You haven't been the same since our fight with Medusa.""

True. The conniving little bitch had managed to sink her fangs deep before the death blow. An old adage about snakes came to mind, about how the head was still dangerous once cut away from the body. Whether it was something she did, or if it was just the Kishin Madness that had swamped the air, Stein had felt his steady slide towards insanity.

""Death has spoken to you."" Not a question. Death may have been nothing more than a white skull cloaked in shadow, but Stein had spent a lifetime reading the nuances that even shadow could not conceal.

""He is worried about you. So am I.""

""I told him that I will handle it."" Determination backed not by confidence, but by desperation. Sometimes he could almost feel clawed hands pulling him further and further into shadows edged with blood, three eyes watching him with malevolent expectation.

""I know you're slipping."" It was not laughter he saw dancing in bright green eyes, but bright light reflecting off shining steel. ""Do you think I can't feel the darkness that is eating you from the inside out?"" Spirit pressed a hand against his chest, fingers clenching in the olive green shirt he never seemed to be without.

""I have always been mad, Senpai."" Memory enhanced by madness allowed him to relive the quick spasm as relaxed muscles protested the scalpel's intrusion. Even asleep, Spirit had been so trusting.

""Not like this. You need to fight it, Stein. We can't afford to lose you.""

Stein took a quick drag on his cigarette as memory and reality merged, bringing with it the copper tang of spilled blood. ""You assume fighting would change anything."" Something chuckled, twisted darkness that gleamed with a three-eyed gaze the color of old blood. Memories twisted by madness pressed against the back of his eyes; harsh lights illuminating pale flesh, skin parting beneath the razor edge of his scalpel. ""Maybe I'm already lost.""

""Don't say that, Stein!""

Stein's eyes burned in his sockets, his joints stiff as he surged to his feet. His lips stretched into a macabre smile, the skin tight as it struggled to conform to the unnatural position. ""Truth is pain, Spirit. I take delight in both.""

Spirit didn't move as Stein stalked towards him. A fool that clung to hope even as it frayed between his fingers. Stein didn't stop until their bodies were flush, and the desire to touch lifted his hands. At one point he would have checked the impulse, but now all was shattered needs and melted rainbows out of the corner of his eye.

""I never found it you know."" Stein pressed a hand against Spirit's heart, felt the strong rhythm that never faltered. Such strength, steel hidden in a sheath of flesh and blood.

""Found what?"" Spirit's voice had faded to a dull whisper, eyes wide. Still no fear, but now there was wariness.

""I never found what made you strong.""

Wariness faded, replaced with solemn warmth that fought to banish the icy touch of madness. ""There are some things you can't dissect, Stein.""

""Maybe I just didn't look in the right place.""

Exasperated amusement rather",candidate00005
"Zevran is surprised when he wakes up to the tight, course burn of rope around his wrists, a sharp ache throbbing in the back of his skull. He thinks he was hit with a sword pommel but isn't sure, remembers fighting, the sudden drop in his stomach with the realization that the Warden would not be so easily taken. Then darkness in the wake of pain as it knifed into the back of his skull.

It's not the rope that surprises him. This is hardly the first, nor even the tenth time he can remember waking up in such a state. Neither is it the notion he was hit over the head. Again, that has happened far too often. No, he thinks as he draws in a ragged breath, squinting up at the Warden looming over him, his companions fainter shadows behind him. He is rather surprised he woke up at all.

He can see the Warden's surprise when he introduces himself, then proceeds to lay out all the information he can offer; who hired him, where he came from, what his intent had been. Although that last one is a bit obvious, it can't hurt to spell it all out. It isn't as if he has anything to lose by this point. He is a dead man walking, or rather, lying down; was the moment he failed to kill the Warden.

Zevran tells the Warden everything and then waits for the sword to fall, knowing that this time he will feel the blade, and there will be no waking up. He is at peace with that, knew the outcome when he first agreed to kill the Warden.

The Warden's appearance surprises him however, dark hair and light eyes, his face framed by sweeps of faded ink that slice across his cheek bones and sweep down to disappear beneath the line of his jaw. He is quiet, the Warden, listening and asking questions without the outrage that Zevran expected. Attempted assassinations are hardly pleasant and while there is anger there, it is banked behind the man's cool gaze, contained in sardonic questions and the tight grip of his hand on the hilt of his sword.

It is the Warden's control and whatever quirk that led him to preserve the life of his potential assassin that prompts Zevran to make his offer. Part of it is reflex, a conditioned response against overwhelming odds to ensure survival. The rest, he wishes he knew, curiosity maybe. He lets his tongue work its magic for what might be the last time and waits to see what this mysterious Warden will do next.

He blinks when the Warden accepts his offer, gathers his wits enough to cover his sudden intake of breath with a wide smile. When the rope is cut and a hand offered, it occurs to him that where there is an ending there are also beginnings, and death comes in many forms.

He takes the Warden's hand and gets to his feet, wonders how this gamble will pay off in the end. As he follows his new companions he doesn't look back, instead considers the Warden and the power of second chances.",candidate00005
"between Will and Jane.  He’d seemed genuinely surprised, as if he couldn’t understand what was happening.  Luckily he hadn’t asked Will for an explanation, which was just as well since Will didn’t think he could find the words without offending him.

To put it simply, Benji was far too trusting for this line of work.

Will started slow.  He dragged the edge of his fingernail along the collar of Benji’s t-shirt.  Benji responded by absently reaching up to scratch at the back of his neck, mumbling nonsense under his breath.  Will waited a full minute before repeating the motion, muffling his laughter even though Benji wouldn’t be able to hear him through the headphones.

When Benji still didn’t catch on after the third time, Will decided to step things up.  Taking a step back he bent down so he could blow gently on the back of Benji’s neck.

“What the--?”  This time Benji twisted around, his whole body starting when he spotted Will.  With a huff he pushed the headphones back so they slid down and settled around his neck.  “How long have you been there?”

“You’ll never know,” Will said with a smirk.  He turned towards the fridge now that the game was up, asking over his shoulder, “Do you want anything?”

“No, I’m good.  Shouldn’t you be sleeping?”  Benji twisted in his chair so he could keep Will in sight.  The light from the lap top screen highlighted the dark circles around his eyes, the lines around his mouth.

“I couldn’t sleep.”  Will grabbed a bottle of water, hesitated, then grabbed a second one.  He nudged the fridge door closed with his elbow before returning to the table.  He set one bottle down next to Benji before twisting the cap off his and taking a long drink.  Rather than sit he leaned against the table, one hand gripping the edge while the other held the bottle.  He dipped his head towards the laptop.  “I could ask you the same question.  Do you think you should be doing this right now?”

“I was too wired to sleep so I figured I would take another look at the virus we grabbed.  Do you realize how close this guy came to bringing down the economic system of this country?”  Benji sagged back in his chair, eyes bright with anger. “He could have beggared everyone and all because he--”

Setting his water bottle aside, Will pushed away from the table and stepped in close, his hands resting on Benji’s shoulders.  He worked his fingers into the tight muscles as he spoke, voice soft.  “We got him, Benji.  We stopped him, and now he’s going to spend the rest of his life in some eight by ten cell, where his only human interaction is the food that gets shoved through a slot in the door.”

Benji’s head fell back until it rested against Will’s stomach.  “Yeah, I know.  It was just…,” he sighed, “it was too close.”

Will remembered the sight of Benji hunched over his lap top, sweat spotting his temple and his fingers moving in a blur as he did everything in his power to stop the virus in its tracks.  In the end it hadn’t come down to bullets or bombs, but the final stroke of the ‘Enter’ key with seconds to spare.  He’d known Benji would pull through.

“This isn’t our first near-miss, Benji.  It certainly won’t be our last.  It’s inevitable that one day we’re going to fail, so you should focus on our successes.”  Will was lucky in that he got the lesson without the consequences.  He never forgot that if it weren’t for Ethan he would have an innocent on his conscience.  He’d managed to avoid that so far, and he hoped it lasted.

Benji rubbed his face.  “I know you’re right, but that doesn’t seem to help very much.”

“Give it time.”  Will loosened his grip on Benji’s shoulders, fingers skimming over the thin t-shirt.  “As for right now, I think you should come to bed.”  He dragged his thumbs down the back of Benji’s neck.

His ministrations earned a low groan.  “I want to, I mean really really want to, but I have to get this finished or Brassel will find an excuse to dump me back into being a technician.”

“You’re dedication is commendable.”  Will leaned over and slowly pushed the laptop closed.  “But I’m going to have to insist.”

“Will, I have to finish this!”  Benji tried to sound firm, but Will could feel his resolve breaking.  It might have had something to do with the hand sliding down the front of his shirt.

“I won’t be able to sleep unless I can feel you next to me.”  Will’s admission was quiet, hanging in the air between them.  What they had was still new, a bond that",candidate00005
", not when she knew what was waiting for her in her dreams.

Looking back, she supposed that she should have known better than to think it was over. After all she had endured in her journey through the Labyrinth, she should have been suspicious.

She didn't understand why she hadn't seen it. Had she really been so naïve? She had made her way through the Labyrinth, had been locked in the oubliette, had nearly had her head pulled from her shoulders, had had to rip her way out of a dream, something that still haunted her. And all it had taken to get Toby was to deny the Goblin King with words?

In that crucial moment, she had forgotten that this story was no fairytale come to life. It was something so much more fantastic, something that held the terrible, knife edge of reality. And like knives, it cut both ways.

Sarah closed her eyes, wanting to cry as she remembered how simple the world had been back then. She had been the heroine, the one to save her baby brother and vanquish the evil Goblin King. But she hadn't understood, not like she did now.

She should have seen. She had never stopped to consider why Hoggle would be so frightened of Jareth, what had caused her friend to betray her. It had never occurred to her what it would take for a man like Jareth to be King of the Goblins. The goblins had been fierce, nasty creatures, and she had never once stopped to consider what that meant about their king. The one to rule them.

It was a week after her journey through the Labyrinth that she knew Jareth had been playing with her. The truth had left her cold and shaking in her dreams, Jareth's laughter as bold as a pair of hands skimming over her sides. He had then served to enlighten her. Everything she'd done, the words of 'power' that she had spoken had been nothing but a game to him. A game that he had allowed her to win.

He had played her game, and now she was expected to play his. Only this time it wasn't her brother that was at stake, it was Sarah herself.

Sarah closed her lips against the sob that lingered in the back of her throat, her eyes burning from lack of sleep. She was so tired, but she wouldn't, couldn't sleep. Not when Jareth was waiting for her where reality ended and dreams began.

This fight was nothing like the last. Before she had been fighting for her brother, had been filled with a sense of purpose and knowing. The goal had been clear, and the consequences unbearable. The battle she now endured had none of the certainty, and she found herself up against a foe that was far more dangerous than anything the Labyrinth could throw at her. Jareth alone had been daunting, and faced with her own desires as well, her defenses were crumbling. It was so much easier to persevere against an outside force, to push back. Caught up in the battle against her self as much as Jareth, Sarah was floundering.

Jareth's game was complex, with rules that she could never hope to understand or learn. He came with sly smiles and gleaming crystal gifts, and magic lingered in the air after he left. There was something in his eyes, something dark that repelled her, even as it drew her in. She was a fly caught in his spider's web, only the web was made of finest crystal, and his game for her was not the simple one of prey and predator.


""Sarah, beware. I have been generous up until now, and I can be cruel.""


His words from that fateful confrontation continued to haunt her, echoing through her mind with newfound clarity. She would be honest with herself and say that he had warned her, couching it in abstract words and hidden meaning. In his own way, he had offered her a way out. Allow him this win, and she would escape the second, deeper game he was planning. She hadn't understood, and even if she had, her brother would always be too high of a price to pay. Not even her dreams were worth her brother's life as a human.

""You have no power over me.""

Her whisper fell flat in the darkness, nearly swallowed by the storm that continued to rage just outside. What had happened, when had everything changed? Why had she been able to defy him? Jareth twisted his words, and proclaimed that he had allowed her to win, but she had remembered the frustration in his eyes as she said those words. If nothing else had been real, she believed for that one moment, he truly had no power over her.

""What changed?"" Her voice was thin. Exhaustion was creeping up on her, sinking tempting fingers of oblivion into her tired mind.

You are no longer a child, my dear. His voice flitted through her mind, reaching her as she dangled on the cusp of sleep. Now you are something more.

"Erica is sprawled on the bed, using her mouth to investigate the soft skin covering Boyd's hip, dragging her tongue across the sharp point of bone with relish, when she hears the bathroom door open behind her.

""About time,"" she murmurs, rolling her eyes up to see Boyd's expression as he gets first glimpse, and the sharp flash of interest she sees raises the anticipation another notch, heat gathering between her legs until she can feel the wet heat building between her thighs. ""I didn't think you were going to come out at all.""

She takes her time rolling over, wants this moment to last, the quick, deep thrum of Boyd's heartbeat singing in her ears, the lighter, faster thrum of Isaac's pulse as he waits for her. Her first glimpse of Isaac takes her breath away, and she lets her eyes slowly travel down the dark tank top and the sheen of sweat on his shoulders and neck, the barely there stretch of fabric that can barely contain his erect cock, and last of all the fish net thigh highs that do absolutely wonderful things to his legs and all sorts of filthy things to her imagination.

There's a spike of lust in the room that smells like all three of them and she lets her mouth fall open so she can taste it, lets it heat her from the inside out and make her nipples contract in something that feels like it could almost be pain. She slides off the bed and onto the floor in one graceful step, her hair falling against her naked back in a caress.

""So you like it, huh?"" Isaac swallows, muscles contracting along the length of his throat, before smiling. ""I figured you would.""

""You can say that again,"" Erica breathes before she's in Isaac's space, fisting a hand into his hair and pulling him into a kiss that has no room for anything gentle. Not when she can feel the burn behind her eyes and the barely there press of fangs against her lips that means her wolf is close to the surface. She wants to shove him down and ride him, to feel the faint scratch of the fishnets on her ass, his low whines as Boyd keeps his mouth occupied.

There's a low rumble from the bed and Erica pulls back with a huff, slides a look over her shoulder. Boyd just looks at her and she rolls her eyes before using her grip in Isaac's hair to guide him towards the bed. She likes the way Boyd makes Isaac moan, so she can stand to share.

Boyd pulls Isaac onto the bed, slips a finger into the waistband of Isaac's panties and pulls that little bit so his cock can spring free. She hadn't thought the situation could get any hotter but the sight of Isaac's cock jutting out of his panties with the fishnets pressing white lines into his thighs makes her so wet she can't quite stifle the needy little moan that builds in the back of her throat.

She isn't really sure how it happens, only that she's moving forward and Boyd has turned Isaac around, so she can see his large eyes and kiss swollen mouth, his cock curling against his belly without the panties to hold it down. She pushes the panties down to his knees, holds the fish nets in place where the elastic keeps it secure, the thin lines scratching at her palms as she leans into to lick at the head of his cock.

Beneath Isaac's moan she hears the faint pop of the lube and grips at Isaacs thighs hard enough to get the chance to admire the bruises beneath the fish nets before they fade. She doesn't wait for Boyd. Not with their combined arousal making the air taste of spices on the back of her tongue. She seals her mouth over the head of Isaac's cock and then down, tilts her head so she can swallow around him. She knows when Boyd gets a finger inside, Isaac's low moan ratcheting up into keening desperation that has him gripping her hair tight enough to hurt.

Erica hums, fingers pressing hard against the fishnets. She lets Isaac start thrusting and each scrape against her fingers goes straight to her clit. She wants to press into that slick heat with her fingers, but forces her hands to stay on Isaac's thighs as he fucks her throat.

She'll get her turn.",candidate00005
"Nothing was the same.

Hands clenched at her sides, Sarah turned in a slow circle. Everything looked the same. She had been coming to this park for as long as she could remember. Nothing had changed, and yet everything was different.

Sarah couldn't pinpoint it at first. It was a subtle feeling, more an implied sensation of 'wrongness'. Looking around, there were no glaring declarations of change. The bench Merlin had sat on that afternoon so long ago was still there. The trees were just beginning to shed their leaves, following the silent prompting of fall. Out of the corner of her eye she could see joggers and bikers make their way across the small bridge spanning the lake that was the park's life blood.

Feeling lost and out of touch, she gingerly seated herself on the stone bench. The chill that clung to the pale stone seeped through her jeans, and she shivered, drawing her arms around her middle. It was unnerving how alien this place seemed. It was as if her time Underground had irrevocably changed how she viewed the Aboveground.

Sarah's breath caught in her throat as she realized just how she had referred to her world. Only it wasn't her world anymore. Now it was one of two worlds, and the Aboveground could not begin to match the depth of its twin. Ensnared by the comparison of the two, Sarah's mind brought up the image of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. They were one in the same, only with two very different faces that were bound by magic. One was the monster, only Sarah couldn't decide which of the two worlds held the heart of darkness.

The grass, where before it had been lush and vivid, was now dull and brittle beneath her feet. The sky was bland; the blue was faded and worn by the passage of time and life it self. The orange and yellow leaves were rotting at the base of their parent trees, the musky scent overwhelming the flowers that struggled nearby.

When compared to the warm wind of Underground, the sharp, biting cold of Aboveground was unbearable. The air from Underground filled her lungs and tingled with every breath. She saw clearer down there, the sounds were sharper, and the tastes more intense. The lush taste of a peach still danced across her tongue, there and gone with every breath. The cold wind of Aboveground reminded Sarah more of the cold touch of metal at the nape of her neck.

The Underground had revealed to her the pitfalls of dreams gone rogue and horrible wishes whispered in a dark room. It had turned stable reality into a pitfall of treachery and leering shadows. It had done all this, and it was the World Above that left her trembling and fearful.

The deep rolling chimes of a clock reached her, and she started, her mind flashing back to a clock that bore thirteen numbers instead of twelve. She looked to the distant clock tower where her gaze was drawn to the elegant hands that marked the time. She had never stopped to consider the clock tower before. That it looked strange without the number thirteen reigning high over the other numbers was just another sign of how much things had changed.

How Jareth would laugh if he saw her now. She may have managed to deny him in the end with her words, but Sarah realized that in the end he had won. She got her brother, but he had stolen her whole world.

Shivering from an abrupt gust of icy wind, Sarah curled in on her self and closed her eyes, her forehead pressed against her knees. Her long hair fell around her legs as she saw not the drab world that was her sanctuary turned prison, but the sparkling world of magic and fire orange skies that was her nightmare turned fantasy.

Such a pity.",candidate00005
"head tilted to the side as if pondering a mystery.  “You went somewhere else.  I brought you back.”

     “Is there a reason you’re in here?” Ed asks, voice sharp with fear and regret that he refuses to acknowledge.  He will see his brother again.  He will get Al’s body back and he will save his country.  There is no other option.

     “Not really.  I was bored.”  Instead of moving away Greed leans against the desk where Ed’s feet had been.  “Do you really think your friend can over power me?”

     “He’s done it before.  He can do it again.”

     Greed’s eyes narrow.  “I was caught off guard.  It won’t happen again.”

     “So you say,” Ed scoffs.  “But we both know that’s not true.  Ling won’t ever give up, not when he knows his clan is counting on him.  He cares about his people too much to do anything but keep fighting.”

     “Caring will only get a person so far,” Greed murmurs.  He smiles, eyes moving inward as he stares over Ed’s head.  “I will admit I am rather fond of him, though.  He may be annoying, but he’s almost as greedy as I am.”  When Greed’s smile widens Ed knows he’s not going to like what’s coming.  “I can see his desires, you know.  All his little dreams spread out before me.  Some aren’t very imaginative, such boring little things that only a human could want, but others…”  Fangs flash in the heart of his smile, the sheer alien delight making Ed shiver in spite of himself.  “He hungers for power, wants to wrap him self around it until there is no beginning and no end.  It’s breath-taking really.”

     Ed swallows hard, can’t, won’t listen to this.  “Go bother someone else, Greed.”  He hopes using the Homunculus’ name will encourage him to listen, but Ed isn’t really surprised when he’s ignored.

     “But I haven’t even gotten to the good part.”  It happens fast.  One moment Greed is sitting on the edge of the desk, the next he’s gone and Ed’s chair is slammed forward.  Ed gasps as he’s crushed against the edge of the desk, the sound feeble as the breath is knocked out of him.  When he tries to shove back his wrists are pinned across the surface of his desk, books and notes sliding off as Ed struggles.  Ed knows he isn’t going anywhere since he can’t use alchemy and his legs are trapped beneath the heavy desk but impossible odds have never stopped him before.

     “What are you up to, Greed?”  Ed asks, determined to remain calm.  He knows, or thinks he knows, that Greed won’t hurt him.  Not after Ed had already agreed to work for him. 

     “Such a greedy thing, our friend Ling.  So strong, so noble.”  Greed’s breath feathers hot against Ed’s cheek, soft bangs brushing against his ear.  “Would you like to know what he dreams about?”

     “I already know what he dreams about,” Ed bites out.  His hands are clenched into fists and he can’t help that, not when every instinct is screaming and he’s trapped with no way out until Greed decides to give him one. 

     “Yes, he wants to be Emperor and he wants to bring his clan honor, those are all the things on the surface, the things he wants people to know about.”  Greed laughs.  “I’m talking about the things he won’t even admit to him self, the dreams that lurk in the back of his mind.”

     “I don’t want to know.”  Ed knows this, knows that no good will come from learning something that clearly gives Greed this much amusement.

     “Oh, I think you should, one of them concerns you after all.  Our Ling has quite the imagination I will admit.”  Greed’s hands flex around Ed’s wrists.  “He has plans for you once he becomes Emperor, Fullmetal.  He wants to take you home with him, wants to cover you in jewels and silk and show you off like the gem you are.  He wants to fuck you, Alchemist, wants to keep you as a prize.”  Greed’s chuckle skims over Ed’s shoulders.  “I can’t say I really blame him.”

     “Stop it.”  Ed’s voice is thick, the words lodged in his throat.  His face is on fire and all he can think about is shoving Greed away and leaping over the desk for the safety of the door. 

     “Would you agree if he asked you to go home with him?  Would you let him take you back to his homeland and keep you like a prize pet?  After a life such as yours I would think it tempting.  A chance to live in the lap of luxury, and I do mean that",candidate00005
